/* This file is a compatability layer.  It allows the usage of flexible box 
model layouts accross multiple browsers, including older browsers.  The newest,
universal implementation of the flexible box model is used when available (see
`Modern browsers` comments below).  Browsers that are known to implement this 
new spec completely include:

    Firefox 28.0+
    Chrome 29.0+
    Internet Explorer 11+ 
    Opera 17.0+

Browsers not listed, including Safari, are supported via the styling under the

<h1 id="Term-Project">Term Project<a class="anchor-link" href="#Term-Project">&#182;</a></h1><p>Joshua Tran, 1001296598, CSE-5334</p>
<h2 id="Objective:">Objective:<a class="anchor-link" href="#Objective:">&#182;</a></h2><p>The objective of this project is to produce a classifier that can take a look at a given review and produce a predicted rating. These reviews will be based off the datasets defined in the references for the 15 million reviews.
Based off these criteria, I'll be implementing a NaiveBayes classifier along side with some pre-built sentiment analyzers to predict the rating of these reviews. However to accomplish this, a few things need to be noted about what has been done.</p>
<h3 id="pre-processing-the-data:">pre-processing the data:<a class="anchor-link" href="#pre-processing-the-data:">&#182;</a></h3><p>The data is vast and large, some of the data needs to pre-processed to ease training, and to get rid of non-helpful information. From the given set of reviews, to simplifiy processing we've made all the classifications into integers 0-10 for 11 total classifications. keeping the floating point representations left review classification values in the thousands of total classifications and seemed over complicated and undesirable. So this has been cleaned up.<br>
Additionally, I rid the data set from reviews that have no comment, because no comments doesn't help us predict actual comments.</p>

<pre>I tend to either love or easily tire of co-op games.  Pandemic joins Knizia&#39;s LoTR as my favorite true co-op.  It edges LoTR out merely in time to set-up and play.  LoTR can be an undertaking to explain enough details so that players enjoy their first time through the game, while Pandemic is fast enough that even if the players don&#39;t quite get everything that is going on, they can try again immediately.
result of sentiment polarity scores:

<h2 id="Applying-sentiment-analysis-to-our-data-set.">Applying sentiment analysis to our data set.<a class="anchor-link" href="#Applying-sentiment-analysis-to-our-data-set.">&#182;</a></h2><p>Below we have a method to be used to apply our vader sentiment analyzer to the data set. The idea here is to use the values generated by our analyzer to produce numerical values to use that will weight a Naive Bayes classifier to produce predictions on what the actual weight of the sentiment is.<br>
It is important to note that this processing takes a little bit of time, so i've generated a routine to check if the the processed sentiment has already been done, and if it has then we can just pull that data.</p>

<h2 id="Using-TextBlob-sentiment-analyzer-and-Custom-Classifier">Using TextBlob sentiment analyzer and Custom Classifier<a class="anchor-link" href="#Using-TextBlob-sentiment-analyzer-and-Custom-Classifier">&#182;</a></h2><p>Next lets try some new stuff. Here we try to do something similar to our previous approach. However, lets try to use TextBlob instead. Interestingly enough, TextBlob actually gives us the ability to use a custom classifer to predict what our sentiment is. Rather than just exclusively looking at positive and negative values.<br>
HOWEVER, this training and classification process is EXTREMELY SLOW. So just to take a look at this, we'll be minimizing the data to around 10 thousand data points that will be split similarly to how we did previously in distribution for test and training sets.<br>
The way this analyzer works is that it uses a feature extractor to send our given sets in and then apply a classifier(NaiveBayes) on it. However, for it to start producing prediction values it needs an initial comment/classification.<br>
Additionally it uses an nltk classifier and wraps around it, making it slower than the sci-kit classifiers.</p>

<pre>[(&#39;And review copie as well.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;1/14...still getting plays, great short 2 player game  2016 - still playing, probably 10-15 games a year&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Really liked this one, but I was the only one in the family who did. Sold.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;I want to like it more, but to be honest, it is fun, but I don&#39;t feel good or bad when I win or lose, just no satisfaction in the win, I did not play better then the other guy I just got luckier?  Oh yea, bought at GC 2011, for $50&#34;, 6.),
 (&#34;Not a whole lot to it...maybe there&#39;s more to it in the advanced game, but the basic game is roll-and-move, roll-and-hope-your-engines-don&#39;t-take-damage.  Bleh.&#34;, 5.),
 (&#39;Quick and fun, gives some of the feelings of its parent game. I really enjoyed playing it&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;The thing I love most about this game is the vectored movement linked with effect of gravity creating objects. This gave me endless fun as a teenager creating areas of space with all sorts of gravity wells! I&#39;ll confess here to being a nerd! Time to dust this one off and twist the arms of some of my contemporary gamers before we go senile.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;Winter Soldier Heroclix  Thor Heroclix  Bought from MeepleMart&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39; &#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;Ça doit être le premier jeu inspiré de la télévision qui est vraiment bon!  Faut être nombreux par contre!  &#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;This is a pretty awesome translation of the Peloponnese tile game to a card game. It&#39;s also somewhat unnecessary, as 90% of the game is identical. I do like the way the calamities are handled better in this, than in the tile game. Still, it&#39;s weird to have two functionally identical games being sold as two different things because one is on cards and one is on cardboard.  Regardless, it doesn&#39;t matter too much which one you buy. It&#39;s a solid game. I went with the card game because I like unpredictable disasters. If you like your difficulty hurdles to come like clockwork, buy the other one!&#34;, 6.),
 (&#34;The only game (other than poker) that I gamble with.  It&#39;s just adds the extra bit of spice to the gameplay!   The tension that builds towards the end of each hand when you know you or someone else may be about to go out is virtually unparalleld by any other game I know.  &#34;, 8.),
 (&#34;A very Gipfy game -- reminiscent of Dvonn and Tzaar. The requirement that all the pieces on the board remain adjacent, and the fact that pieces don&#39;t score points unless they&#39;re adjacent to an enemy, make for interesting tactics.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;First play Jan 2009 - Good game with lots of player interaction.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;2-4 players (best 3), 60 minutes, medium heavy, auction/bidding, tile laying.    Vikings is a nice game, with its viking meeples, its rondel mechanism and its carcassone-esque matching of tiles. If there&#39;s any point against it, it&#39;s that this really works best as a 3-player game. Perhaps 2 players doesn&#39;t offer enough competition and 4 players offers too much. While not special enough to own a physical copy, it&#39;s still fun to play online.  [url=https://yucata.de/en/GameInfo/Vikings]Yucata[/url], [url=http://www.brettspielwelt.de/Spiele/Wikinger/?nation=en]BSW[/url]&#34;, 8.),
 (&#34;Very nice pick up and deliver game. A bit long at 2 hours for a two-player game, but I think it&#39;ll improve once we get used to it. I think I still prefer Eurorails and Duck Dealer, but MoV sure has some upsides.  Suggest.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#34;Too many cards in your hand - which means too many cards in your opponents hand that you have to try and remember and I&#39;m no good at that. The character cards add a nice bit of variety / tactics though&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;Dammn goooood&#39;, 10.),
 (&#39;For me this game falls in the category of games that have potential but then fail because of underdevelopment. There are lots of little tad bits that make this game feel rather unpolished. This games suffers from random money draw, downtime issues, opaque (but clever) scoring mechanism and randomness from the events and scholars that appear. All in all a pity because this game comes with such lovely art, theme and flavor.   &#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;Color&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Can play 2, best with 3 players Up to 2.5 hours Ages 12+ Heavy (3.8)&#39;, 9.),
 (&#34;A great premise, with some excellent mechanics (especially the use of achievements as settings to vary the difficulty), and bonus points for the singleplayer-led design, this game is just slightly let down by having too few options. The expanded material from White Dwarves (adding demons, and an alt. demon prince boss) build on the core nicely, but stat cards for additional enemy types (nothing too outrageous, just alternate weapon output, such as cultist with heavy stubber, chaos space marine with heavy bolter, etc) and the ability to lay/be caught in a small range of traps would have just made the game. To me, it certainly evokes the feel of Metal Gear Solid with the patrol-based system, and the four assassin minis are superb, but the enemies are just old cheap sprues thrown in for clearance - and even then, they are the most basic iterations. The tile quality isn&#39;t quite on par with other releases (Burning of Prospero, Silver Tower, etc), but on the whole a worthwhile release.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;Это игра для палеонтологов! я не такой! Пусть они в этой игре создают динозавров. а потом в жизни ищут.(не играю)&#39;, 4.),
 (&#39;Bought in May 2017. Traded away in May 2018.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Of course you can\&#39;t deny this game is very good: the complexity is well thought through, ,with different possible strategies, the various mechanics match the theme very well, and the production quality is very high.  Although I don\&#39;t dislike heavy games and I do like the theme of this game, I didn\&#39;t enjoy it as much as I wanted to. Detailed planning is very important, something like: &#34;I have to get this, go there, do that, to eventually take that action&#34;. So very prone to analysis paralysis. But the rewards you get for all this thinking are not very spectacular, you just do well at running your gallery.  I would prefer a heavy game like Food Chain Magnate (an equally complex game) where the focus is more on anticipating the other players\&#39; moves and the outcome of a well-executed plan is way more satisfying.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;my rating is that high in the context of word games&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;Had a lot of fun with this one.  Great components and excellent, well-integrated theme.  Luck is certainly a factor in the artifact digging but to me that also adds a touch of excitement and thematic realism.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Simple game, anyone can pick it up and play it. Recommend it.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;1-5 giocatori 90-115 minuti&#39;, 9.),
 (&#34;With three simple rules this game is a quick playing gem of an abstract.  Short enough to allow you to experiment, easy for new players to pick up but with a depth that&#39;s surprising.  I&#39;ve played dozens of games, but been careful not to play more then a few at a sitting lest the game play wear thin.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;Quick and fairly interesting.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Like Go, Chess is one of those games where you have to devote a lot of time to become &#34;good&#34;. I would rather play 50 other games throughout my life than trying to become a proficient chess player.&#39;, 5.),
 (&#34;Would play, but incredibly random and only small chances to mitigate the randomness.  Also theme only comes through because of lots of random encounters which I don&#39;t like.  Too much set up&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;Items Owned:  [b] Deluxe Starter Set (Starter + Map Set 1) Map Set 2  Good Guys(Frodo BS-108, Sam BS-120, Merry BS-116, Pippin BS-118, Gandalf BS-110, Aragorn BS-098, Boromir BS-102, Legolas BS-114, Eowyn BS-106, and Gimli BS-112)  King of the Dead (PD-005) Oathbreakers (PD-013) x5  Witch-King (BS-060) Ringwraiths (BS-052) x8 Saruman (BS-054) Moria Goblin Fighters (FE-008)x5 Uruk-Hai Warrior (BS-027) x3  Cave Troll (PL-003)x2 Balrog Treebeard Mordor Troll Fell Beast w/Ring Wraith   [/b]&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;So simple and pure, yet so fun. Amazing how much entertainment and game decision you can get with so little components and rules.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;An ingenious way to create beautiful, varied little miniatures.  Now if only someone would make a game to use with them...&#39;, 2.),
 (&#39;Solo Player Value = Good.  Two Player Value = Good.  Three Player Value = Good.   Castle Ravenloft is a fun cooperative dungeon crawl game that scales fantastically from a solo player to five players.  Castle Ravenloft carries the Dungeons &amp; Dragons license and uses the general flavor, terms, items, monsters, etc., of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. But this is a different version of Dungeons &amp; Dragons then what many might be accustomed too.  The Dungeons &amp; Dragons system used in Castle Ravenloft has more in common with the card driven Pathfinder system then the tried and true 4th Edition D&amp;D that many know well. That Pathfinder system is then further altered to adapt it to work in a board game. Although altered, the base D&amp;D system is still intact. The base D20 system is present and easy to use. Triggered card abilities power the individual character abilities.  While some might be put-off by this modified D&amp;D system, I think it works well for this game. The D&amp;D system in Castle Ravenloft is easy to learn and manipulate making it very accessible to all levels of gamers.  Essentially Castle Ravenloft is a multi-player solitaire game. Each turn the player gets to perform his player action and them must act as the game against the players. This keeps the game clean and smooth and allows the game to scale well. The constant game actions keeps the game lively and tough on the players which I find challenging and fun.  The art work is nice as the figures are well done. The modular board is standard D&amp;D fair.  The scenarios work very well and scale upward in difficulty.  This offers the players an easy continuing campaign adventure through all the scenarios.   Pro -  - Great use of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons theme and license  - Easy to learn and play - Good dungeon crawl feeling  Cons - - Modified D&amp;D system might put-off some - If you do not like dungeon crawl you will like this game   Overall Playability = 7.3  Design = 7 Strategy = 8 Luck = 9 Artwork &amp; Components = 6 Use of Mechanics = 8 Time of Play = 7 Fun = 8 Innovation = 5 Analysis Paralysis = 7 Theme = 8   Got in 2014  2011 Plays = 1 2014 Plays = 8 2015 Plays = 2     Solo Game List - http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/171377/rygels-solo-game-list  Two Player Game List - http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/171376/item/3192925#item3192925  Three Player Game List - http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/171378/item/3765758#item3765758  &#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;6 jugadores&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Picked this up at PAX South 2017. A difficult but fun game as fitting its theme. First game we got completely destroyed, second game we came very close to winning. Recommended, however there were some typos and confusing parts in the rule book.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;Cheesy dice-fest. Fun if you&#39;re into that sort of thing.&#34;, 4.),
 (&#39;Fun family game.The kids love to &#34;dig&#34; for gems.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;It&#39;s just not that great of an LOTR game, it&#39;s gotten kind of boring after 4-5 playings.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;Medium light worker placement game. It is not so luck-based as it appears to be. &#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;Let&#39;s go back into time....  I only have this for the little kids that come over. It is still a bit nerve wracking to get buzzed!&#34;, 4.),
 (&#39;I really like China (and Web of Power) a good deal.  It plays swiftly and serves as an excellent filler.  &#39;, 9.),
 (&#34;Clever deck builder with the interesting twist of aiming to get your Princess candidate on the vacant throne before anyone else. Lovely presentation, but don&#39;t let the kawaii graphics fool you. Depending on the cards selected, the game can be ruthlessly cutthroat. Lots of variety and replayability, especially with the two expansion packs. But just the basic game is an excellent offering. Highly recommended.&#34;, 9.),
 (&#39;펠트 게임이 전반적으로 어수선해 그다지 좋아하지 않는데 이 녀석은 꽤 괜찮다. 물론 인터페이스가 여전희 어수선하긴 하지만 리플레이성도 좋을것 같고 나름 적당한 인터렉션에 깔끔한 맛이 있다. 인터페이스가 좀 더 간결하고 명확하게 표현된다면 더 높은 점수를 줄 것 같다.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;I think Star Craft is just a superb game. I have integrated my Brood War expansion into the base game, and I can&#39;t see why anyone would play the game without it.&#34;, 9.),
 (&#39;Quick and easy rummy variant featuring an extra suit.  Anyone can learn this in a jiff and it makes for a light easy game of about an hour.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;A decent Dominion clone with poker chips. It strays further from the Dominion mould than other similar games like Tanto Cuore or Penny Arcade due to its heavy reliance on attack chips, health tokens (gems) and player elimination. Whether this improves the game is questionable, but it is at least a bit different, which is a good thing in an overdone genre.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;    CDG    Seven Years War. Have some play weaknesses.    &#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;(48) great filler game, but nothing more than press your luck dice game with zombie theme&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Good WW1 air combat game. VERY nice aeroplanes as well.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;For two players this is our best game! I think we played it around 100 times and still discovering new things!&#39;, 10.),
 (&#39;Une des plus grandes réussites commerciales de la gamme des Blue Games. Moi, je trouve ça trop chaotique.&#39;, 4.),
 (&#39;Lots of fun if you have more players.  4 is really the best.  But that means I only play with exactly four people.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Not much interaction between players.  It kind of feels like everyone is at the table playing their own game.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;Nice idea taken from Patchistory, gorgeous artwork (not a surprise), but I hate the special 5 actions - they are so fiddly to remember and really not very useful. 70% of the rules are in those actions. I would prefer to have 2 or 3 special actions of one kind (double placement seems fine) and that&#39;s it. I also don&#39;t like the scoring which encourage players to paint multiple copies of only one painting. I&#39;d say that thematically we&#39;re not painters in the game but plagiarists so we train ourselves in painting as accurate copies as possible (through making the same painting all the time) and sell them on a black market.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;There is a surprising amount of strategy to this game.  Subtle moves can have a major impact on the complexion of the game situation.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;A lot of upkeep and gets slow.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Love the series and love the game. Got Kalidasa and Blue Moon which are awesome!&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;A rare beast. It is, at first blush, simply a beast. Its alarmingly long rule-set is filled with finicky exceptions. Its tabletop footprint is gigantic. It presents an intimidating menu of choices at every turn. And plan on setting aside 4-6 hours to play the solitaire game at a leisurely pace.  Yet though the barrier to entry is high, the riches to be found are greater still. Mage Knight performs the most dazzling feat of balance of any game I know. The countless possibilities are calibrated with extraordinary delicacy. As a result, despite the game&#39;s complexity and its many sources of chance - card shuffles, tile draws, dice rolls - the game is almost purely one of skill. But somehow none of this comes at the expense of thematic immersion. All of the moving parts in this dense strategic masterpiece make good thematic sense, leaving you with the feeling of a powerful Mage Knight exploring the land and conquering ever more terrifying foes.  Mage Knight is the tabletop equivalent of War and Peace: grand, challenging, and immensely satisfying.&#34;, 10.),
 (&#39;I am usually not a fan of dice rolling games, but the theme is great and it has quite a few challenging choices in it.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;A bit of character development and a lot of dice. Too cumbersome mechanics and not so well thought powers I think.&#39;, 4.),
 (&#39;Well done solitaire. The concept of switching to the losing side is great for a solitaire game. Sold it during a game purge, a move I regret I may pick up the game again&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Played with 3 players, very fun! Lessens the impact of the assassin and moves the game along fairly quickly.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Lovely game, especially with a glass of rose&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Not so easy to grasp for new player and not as fast as it should be. But a classic.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;After 1,5 plays.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Very simple rules, and very deep challenging gameplay.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;My friend, Matt Hiske, just received this from pre-order.  We played the first scenario.  Fun twist on the hold the line system.  You could easily play the campaign in a couple of hours.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;An interesting stripped down worker placement game, not quite sure the theme lines up that well... but meh. Overall a solid game but sometimes I felt I wanted something deeper from it.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;First historical module of ASLSK!!!&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Version included in the C3i issue #26.  Low unit count, easy rules.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;I want to like this game more than I do, and I keep thinking that might happen down the road, but right now I just can&#39;t get over the complete irrelevance of the Vikings theme, which feels like it was just chosen at random for lack of anything more intuitive or appropriate to the game mechanics.    The mechanics work fine, by the way, and the wheel offers an interesting variation on worker cost, but man oh man, why Vikings?&#34;, 5.),
 (&#39;Ich glaube das ist halt der Inbegriff davon, wie schlecht ein Spiel sein kann, ohne in den Bereich der physischen Unspielbarkeit zu gelangen.&#39;, 2.),
 (&#34;Interesting theme and the game works well with it. There are many paths to victory. It felt like I was doing something interesting each turn. I just didn&#39;t feel it was much fun.&#34;, 5.),
 (&#39;數位板人數稍嫌少了點QQ&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Just boring and disappointing.&#39;, 3.),
 (&#34;A nicely themed area influence game with some bluffing and a need to manage your pieces so you don&#39;t run short. Seems that aiming to be in second place for each scoring sounds a good idea.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#34;*UPDATE play #4 - 4 players - I drank the Kool-Aid. I won the game and I raised my rating to an 8. I&#39;m not proud of this but it was a much more enjoyable game than my previous 3 attempts at it. Like Power Grid, maybe this one is growing on me.  &#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;With rules as written, an overly long rummy-style game that keeps going until death offers its sweet embrace.  Can be salvaged by playing a 10-hand game, where each hand each player can opt to go for a different phase (so long as each player attempts each of the 10 phases over the 10 hands).&#39;, 4.),
 (&#34;I haven&#39;t played Bughouse Chess in quite a few years, and not since I discovered modern board games, but from what I remember of it, it was very fun.  A frantic game with big swings that you always want to play one more time.&#34;, 9.),
 (&#39;Könnyed gyermek játék. &#39;, 4.),
 (&#39;Turtles themed TROUBLE, could be worse; classic intro game for my kids.&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;I really love the available decisions and resource management. The cost of movement feels different than a lot of games, and trading goods around to fulfill contracts is both satisfying, and seems to be thematically appropriate. Variable player powers are drastically different, and all seem like they have good paths to victory. My biggest criticism would be against the component size for gold bars, silk, pepper and camels. The size difference between the small (value=1) and big (value=3) wooden markers is not easy to detect without very close inspection.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#34;This is a really fun game with 4, 5 or 6 especially.  A little bit like Untergang von Pompeii in that you help guide the fire in London to raze other people&#39;s houses.  Easy rules and game play with room for tactics.  You also have secret goals that you especially don&#39;t want to burn, and these may be shared by other players, though you can&#39;t be sure.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#34;Worker placement with unique mechanics, high level of interaction, different strategic options and high levels of tension? I&#39;m sold. Being able to make worker placement locations that opponents have to pay you to move, riskier spots that you can shut down when your opponent tries to use it, resource management - just a really good all rounder.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#34;After a few plays, I&#39;ve found this rather disappointing.  Given the reviews, I thought I would really enjoy it.  The card play just leads to a lot of odd situations that feel completely unreal.  I can see why people like it; it just doesn&#39;t do much for me.  Lowered rating to reflect that I won&#39;t likely ever play this again.&#34;, 4.),
 (&#34;Great at what it tries to do- that is condense the key mechanisms of Arkham Horror into a much quicker and streamlined game. Avoids the &#39;annoying leader&#39; sydrome that co-ops can suffer from by providing enough locations and randomness that you are never sure what the best move will be.   The theme doesn&#39;t suck you in as much as in Arkham Horror. Good story telling takes time, and Elder Sign has clearly sacrificed the story telling aspect by going for a fast experience.   I really like it.  *Ordered from milsims August 2011.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;The only reason this game isn’t a 10 is because the cards are a bit too thin and you can read the the top few words from behind if you don’t put them inside colored backed sleeves. My entire non-gaming family loved this game too! It has been a hit at our gaming group as well.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#34;Was fun and I enjoyed the theme, but the games I&#39;ve played so far had a serious element of streakiness to it.  One player always seems to drawing treasure, one player draws temples, and one player keeps drawing empty fields.  I also wasn&#39;t fond of the fact that on the last turn, the player who goes first basically gets screwed since he has no way to retalliate, but this is partially made up for by the fact that he is likely to get in more turns in before scoring.  Overall, a decent game, and one that I&#39;d play again.  More fun than Mexica.  The auction rules remove the luck element, but also slow down the game significantly.&#34;, 8.),

 (&#39;4-6&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;I want to like this game but I just don&#39;t.  There is everything I want it to be but just not enough of anything to work well.  People discuss its magic but its not there for me.&#34;, 5.),
 (&#39;Played it and loved it! 5 player affair. Nice. Of course, I want more plays!&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;An improvement on RTTA.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;Game has a Fatal flaw in the abstraction in the how immune zone concept is implemented. In reality, the immune zone doesn&#39;t mean the ship can not be damaged when fired at by enemy when within the immunity range. Immune zone means only that shells cannot penetrate the deck armor, nor the side armor within the range band of the immune zone. Well, less than 25% of a ships volume is behind armor, so there is a lot of ship that can be damaged, and severely too.   As a result the game does not allow for the often incapacitating levels of damage that ships accumulated ....at ranges where shells cannot penetrate armor. Also the game doesn&#39;t distinguish between a hit by a 550 lb 11 inch shell and a 1920 lb 15 inch shell...&#34;, 1.),
 (&#39;Fine addition to the series, but not a necessity.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;nice battle card mechanism.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Duel of Ages lite.  The cool factor is so high, however, that it keeps coming out in my game club, week after week.&#39;, 10.),
 (&#34;I really wanted to like this game, and bought a hundred bucks worth of little ships. Alas, while the ships are cool, I dislike the game, and the collectable nature takes away what enjoyment I could have gotten. Given the choice, I&#39;d love to trade this away for something more to my tastes.&#34;, 4.),
 (&#39;2012 BGG.con giveaway  Extra sets of over-sized X-rated tiles added to make  &#34;Streets of New York&#34; using Vegas hooker/stripper cards.&#39;, 10.),
 (&#39;Apples to Apples / CAH with cats.  Actually a fun idea, but poorly implemented.  It should be funny/fun, but instead we quickly had this combo:  &#34;This cat refuses to wear a collar... and never was seen again.&#34;  Which made us sad.  So we stopped playing.    Party games shouldn\&#39;t make you sad.  I could be convinced to play again because, well, it\&#39;s hardly a time or brain commitment.  But really?  Probably not.&#39;, 4.),
 (&#39;Quick but meaty enough game. Enjoyable by experienced players and even by family. Just recommend.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;halfway through the game and it&#39;s getting really dry and slow - 2p is not the best way to play this game.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;An amazingly fun ruthless thriller game!&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;[b]Positive points[/b]: • Excellent foundation game, perfect for non-gamers too • Sufficiently fast-playing making player elimination a non-issue (in most cases) • The cardstock, card size, magnetic-closing box, sleeves truly and poker chips make it a premium game (without it saying so on the box) • Plays significantly better and faster (i.e. sanity checks) at higher player counts (4p+) compared to the original Love Letter  [b]Neutral points[/b]: • The Lovecraft side is very well executed... but the &#34;Love Letter&#34; thematic tie-in still remains a mystery • Most of the gameplay is (intentionally) random (tactical?) and cannot really be mitigated; take it or leave it • Gameplay is even more random (i.e. sanity checks) than the original Love Letter further reducing any sliver of strategy occasionally resulting in an anticlimactic ending; doesn\&#39;t feel as streamlined either • Above can make 3p a bit too chaotic, but it\&#39;s still playable I suppose • Ruleset can be a tad more involved for non-gamers than the original Love Letter  [b]Negative points[/b]: • Cannot recommend at 2p; it almost feels pointless&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Brilliant design and extreme playable with endless variations. Nowadays I only own and play the IOS version for Ipad.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#34;Bus is an interesting splotter game, and for me personally I think one of the better ones. It&#39;s not nearly so obtuse/opaque as many of the others, allowing for players to more easily grasp what is going on. Yet there are still delightfully difficult decisions, players can and will absolutely be devastated by others decisions. The way worker placement works here creates insane amounts of tension in fighting for actions and positioning yourself. The fact each player only has 20 total actions but can choose to use a bunch in one round is also a very clever touch.   It plays in that 60-90 time limit I&#39;m more of a fan of as well for most games. Like most splotter titles, a few bad plays by any one player can really hose them and throw the game to someone else. For that reason I really would only want to play this with a group that dedicates to playing it a few times to get more experience. Else I think the experience is significantly weakened. Given I&#39;m not really in that type of group right now, I&#39;m less interested in really getting this repeated plays--and even if I did find a group like that I think there are other more interesting games to study deeper. &#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;Never a time in which I won\&#39;t play this. I love the theme, even if the &#34;deck-building&#34; is close to a fantasy. &#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;Looks amazing on first impression.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;As of now this is my favorite game. I like that you always think and constantly make decisions playing this game. You have to think about getting actors, completing movies… I also think: how do other players get everything they want and still have lots of money remaining. I am always short on money! Sometimes you just need to have luck in this game.&#39;, 10.),

 (&#34;An ok filler game, but it fell flat with me. If I wanted a filler bidding game, there&#39;s 4 or 5 games I prefer over this one.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#34;The story elements are worked in very well.  I don&#39;t think that really helps for replay, but maybe it would be interesting to be able to plan ahead.&#34;, 6.),

 (&#39;Love this game. GREAT to play with friends&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Un jeu de &#34;construction&#34; et de &#34;blocage&#34;, à base de tuiles et de plateaux individuels. Après quelques parties qui m\&#39;avaient laissé dubitatif, je dois dire que j\&#39;apprécie vraiment ce jeu depuis quelques années. Le seul reproche concerne le fait qu\&#39;il y a un sacré avantages à être 1er joueur plus souvent que ses adversaires. Utilisez la variante disponible sur la fiche de jeu pour contrer ce déséquilibre.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Very enjoyable light set collection game. It was easy to learn and easy to play. The theme makes it fun and the wife likes it too!&#39;, 7.),

 (&#39;Standard deck-building with little interaction.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Such a nice, tight game with interesting choices and strategy.  Only weakness is the last couple of moves are largely predictable table-wide.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Plays similar to a CCG game, but is less complicated&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;INteresting game, but I suspect discovering it is more fun than playing it, once you know it. Thanks to expansions, winter board and a lot of possible faction combinations (including automatic Cat) this point is still far though.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;A very boring children&#39;s game.  It take a w too long to play, and it&#39;s not even fun.   &#34;, 2.),
 (&#39;A hit for a party!&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Your basic worker placement where you get different combinations of goods on different spaces.  Unique aspect is that you can stay on a space on subsequent turns (no benefit, just blocking it) so the opponent has to fight to knock you off.  So, there is a small battle component to the game, and some strategy around blocking strategic actions.  New action tiles come off a deck and can be laid out as desired, but there is only a weak placement aspect.  Tiles are extra cardboard and easy to manage.  However, the meeples (different kinds of cowboys) are cardboard too, not so convenient.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Played it once and was thoroughly underwhelmed.  As a former (casual) MTG player, Blue Moon seemed like a very pale reflection of MTG.&#39;, 5.),

 (&#39;Like Modern Naval Battles.  Blast your opponents.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;A game with a great theme. Played it with only two players and the rules are simple and quick to learn. First try was quite calm but the second try more savage an trying to ruin each others chances to score. Nice components and illustrations too.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Wow - this one flew under my radar.  I liked it from about minute 1, and all throughout the game.  This has a Notre Dame feel, but I like it slightly more.&#39;, 9.),

 (&#39;Great game.  Easy to learn but lots of depth and tactical challenge.&#39;, 10.),
 (&#39;Gotta love eBay! Got this for the Simpsons theme, and it turned out to be a FANTASTIC drinking game.  Noisy, what with the metal cans and excessive drunken shaking, but we can play this for hours and hours when the beer is pouring.  For this reason - my wife hates this game.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;Neutral - on occasion.  Since the deck composition is pretty clear, it&#39;s not hard to calculate probabilities. So it&#39;s actually a gambling game with some tactics  rather than pure a push-your-luck one.   &#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;My favorite designer has put together another winner. While the high fantasy theme of Mage Knight is a fairly  dull, run-of-the-mill, orc-fest -- the game itself is epic.  Most of the stuff we see in this genre is either a dungeon crawl (like decent), or some sort of Magic: The Gathering clone.  Mage Knight tells a much broader tale.  Instead of trudging through a dungeon or engaging in some sort of spell-slinging wizard duel, you trudge through multiple dungeons and sling many spells.  You also raise your own army or followers and can even burn down the occasional monastery just for fun.  There are several Vlaada trademarks in this design.  One of which is his tendency to resolve critical gameplay moments with a kind of puzzle solving rather than a die role.  The plus side is that it can be very satisfying to play your hand of cards in just the right way as to move to the wizard tower and defeat the guardian there, while still having enough left over to bank a mana crystal for the next round.  The downside is that sometimes there are moments in the game that lose their dramatic punch as everything has already been worked out by the time it\&#39;s your turn.  It\&#39;s one thing to see a battle hinge on that critical die roll it\&#39;s another to have the maths already in your pocket and have it all just &#34;work out&#34;.  Still there is so much variety and strategic opportunities in this game that it really deserves your attention.  It\&#39;s a true exploration game done right(much like High Frontier actually), where you really feel like you are earning every new encounter, every spell, every artifact.  Warning:  This is best explored first on your own (a few solo rounds will be really helpful), and then probably with one other experienced player.  Don\&#39;t dive into a 4-player game with all newbies.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;I don&amp;#039;t have time for miniature games any more... nor does it interest me. Painting is a very time-consuming job. But if you&amp;#039;re into this kind a thing, then this game is the best.&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;This game is somewhat interesting, but is kind of boring due to the randomness of the game.  Not that randomness is bad, but there is little else to this game.&#39;, 4.),

 (&#34;After the novelty wears off it&#39;s just not terribly fun.  Of course the Gazebo is the greatest monster in any RPG.&#34;, 5.),
 (&#39;Buen juego de palabras. Una vuelta de tuerca al típico Scattergories. Por equipos. Estresante. Recomendable.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Own Digital Version too.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;Fun game with great theme, especially with a full compliment of 5 players. Some folks have ripped the randomness of the combat system but we play the game right out of the box with no problems. I downgrade my rating a bit because some actions, specifically the train, just don&#39;t seem to ever get selected.  Update: Sold.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#34;Many good things in this game but the campaign victory condition is why I&#39;ve scored it so low - if someone (or maybe me) could come up with more appropriate victory conditions then I would re-score it.  My problem with the campain victory conditions is as follows:  Historically Germans were forced to hold land as long as possible, if the game doesn&#39;t include this element then it&#39;s just too far from history for my liking. In this game victory is determined at the end of the game by how many cities the germans hold and more importantly the strength of their army. So if you mangaged to grab Stalingrad (to destroy the resource units there)you would not even consider trying to hold on to it for a single game turn once you realised that it would be impossibly to hold it to the end and it would costs you strength steps. The germans have to conserve strength steps as they add to the victory point tally.  IMO All east fromt game needs a mechanism to force the Germans into desprate defensive battles.&#34;, 4.),
 (&#39;Eric Lee Smith is one of the best all times designer and with this game he reached his best performance! This is &#34;the&#34; strategic game on American civil war. A must have!&#39;, 10.),
 (&#39;The game works fine and offers much variability as it is to expect from a Deckbuilding game. I like the possibilities for Teamplay, Raids and Dungeons. The basic game works just fine. But TCG in 2013? This is soo Old-School. Come on...&#39;, 7.),

 (&#39;My FAVORITE Fluxx edition by far!! I love love love the references on every card and the special rules for this deck are AWESOME!!&#39;, 10.),
 (&#39;This is a good game for kids - nice and simple, but you can make it harder as they grow. I play the simplest version with my kids (4 and 6).(JW)&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Outstanding two tiered auction game.  If you&amp;#039;re not careful, certain combos of powers can be unbalancing though.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;Very hard game to come by, and if you are lucky enough to find one... You are in for a world of hurt if you don&#39;t find someone to teach you the game. The rule book is terrible.   That said the game is Rube Goldberg assembly of mechanics that are held together well through a highly thematic experience. Nice mix of short term tactical opportunism, as well as trying to balance longer term objectives. I was surprised how much I liked it, and this rating may well go up with repeat plays.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;Building the cars is more fun than running them. Still, one of the favs from my youth.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;I finally got to play this one, after sitting on the shelf for 18 months. It was about what I thought it would be-light and silly. The thing I like best though (though it may be difficult to articulate) is that this game isn&#39;t heavy-handed. It&#39;s a trick-taker without feeling too much like a trick-taker, if that makes sense. Diamonds, for example, is a solid game, but it feels like a trick-taker on steroids. When you&#39;re not a huge fan of the trick-taking genre, you need a game that doesn&#39;t take it self too seriously, and the Dwarf King does a great job in that regard. &#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;29 EURO&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Very fun! The main goal is to gather enough food and resources to fight the enemies. And I love the peek so that you can prepare for battle on the ships. Want to play again!&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;I played this game once.  It lasted hours.  Eventually I won but man it was a long game for such a simple premise.  Reminds me of a win 3.1 game I used to play.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Based on one playthrough. This game has some very interesting mechanics, especially the merging of companies. Do not get to attached to one company, because when companies merge, the highest bidder gets it. A really fun game, which requires a lot of planning and cooperation between players in order to get to deliver your goods for a good price.  Very nice technology mechanic, where you advance one step on one of the 5 different tracks each turn, but my first impression is that everything looks really good to advance, and each different tech offers a different bonus on the game which you can take advantage of. Much player interaction with companies that merge, cities that can only take a certain amount of goods each, and you always have to use boats to deliver the goods (which usually is somebody elses boats). Overall it left a very good first impression, and a game that might be played a lot in my competative gaming group.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#34;I&#39;ve only logged live plays; I have played some online poker, but the world of poker kind of puts me off. Maybe some other time.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#34;I&#39;m not a big fan of this one but surprisingly almost always willing to play if somebody wants to. It has a very nice flow and speed with no downtime and doesn&#39;t drag on to long. Sometimes your cards are worse but you can atleast try to play them the best possible. While competitive, it&#39;s lighthearted and you have your best shit-eating grin on your face when you just squeeze the fifth card into a row and hand your mate all these cards. Unfortunately in the following round this grin may just greet you back ;) &#34;, 6.),
 (&#34;[b][22 Jan 2020] - 7 (1 play)[/b] [i]Good - usually willing to play.[/i] BGG rating guide update.  [b][30 Oct 2019] - 7 (1 play)[/b] [i]Good game, usually willing to play[/i] Based on a single play with not the greatest explanation of rules. It&#39;s an tableau/engine builder game where by the end of the game, if played correctly, you have single actions with effects that chain on and on. The game does a nice job of taking away the number of actions every round to balance out the last round from being much longer than it needs to be. The game does look nice but none of those embellishment really made the game better to play. I&#39;d give it some more plays to see how it goes and it might be a nice game to pickup on sale.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;This is really clever.  It can be a chatoic, &#34;gotcha&#34; party game, enjoyed by 6 year olds, 16 year olds, and 36 year olds.  Or it can be a somewhat serious flight simulation game with a suprising amount of chrome.  Totally depends on the crowd, and what rules you play it with.  It\&#39;s rare you get a party game and a chromey wargame in the same box . . .  Pleasantly surprised with how well it scales, both in terms of players and difficulty.&#39;, 8.),

 (&#34;Play the Gaia Project instead: it&#39;s almost the same but slightly better, and the look and theme fit the game better.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#34;What I love: artwork, uses creativity and language skills What I don&#39;t love: even though we got an expansion, there are cards that come up that are familiar. &#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;Game is good for a fun horror-themed romp. Don\&#39;t play it with anyone that is too competitive, because based on the house layout and experience level of the eventual &#34;betrayer&#34;, once the haunt happens, the game can greatly favor one side or the other. Plus, a &#34;betrayer&#34; that doesn\&#39;t have a good grasp of the rules (especially when they change during the haunt) can ruin a play. This still gets played a good deal due to accessibility of the initial mechanics and fun theme.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Honestly, not the greatest game out there, BUT! the amount-of-game-in-the-box-per-dollar ratio is through the roof on this one. Masters of Venice is so cheap you may as well buy it, if you have any interest in economic games.&#39;, 7.),

 (&#39;점수를 먹이는 재미가 쏠쏠할 것 같다. 다만 승리를 위해서는 절제가 필요할 것 같기도... 먹이느냐 vs 먹이려다 먹느냐 vs 안먹기위한 안전제일주의.. 플레이어의 게임 성향에 따라 재미의 강도가 달라질 듯...&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Great Euro game with lots of different areas to balance.  Moderate player interaction and a good sense of progression throughout the game.  It can be a bit tedious to teach/learn.&#39;, 8.),

 (&#39;Fun small group game because there is a lot of co-operative discussion .&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;when this came out, I was thinking about playing it at weird moments, like breakfast or the underground...  2p. 6-8-2  update : with the first cards of the Intrigue, this has just become even better...&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;Played this game at GenCon 2014. Some will like this game a lot but this is not my favorite type of game. It really focuses on negotiation first and foremost.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;There is so much in this game--great concept, great components, and an ingenious system of play.  In a way it&#39;s something of a masterpiece, and as such, I would love to give it a higher rating. However, it is also difficult to play, not that the system is so arcane, but because there is so much.  Perhaps if I had more game-partners to play with we could attack it together.  But unfortunately there is no one I know that is interested.  As a consequence, I am left to go it alone, an FanG is not as inviting to solitaire play as Touch of Evil is.  I&#39;ll bet it&#39;s a blast with a group, but solitaire, it&#39;s a 500 lb gorilla.&#34;, 8.),

 (&#34;Well designed Roll and Write, but has absolutely no player interaction. None. Playing this alone or in a group is the same, except for comparing scores. It&#39;s alright!&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;&#34;WOW the dice is in a DOME... COOL...&#34; That is what you might think when you see that game but appart of the COOL dice in a DOME, the game is not good.&#39;, 2.),
 (&#34;Picked up at GenCon. It&#39;s a great game!&#34;, 10.),
 (&#39;Fun Pirate game. Can get messy with all the calculations if you think about it hard. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would, given all the so-so reviews.&#39;, 7.),

 (&#39;Pure auction fun, take it or leave it(but at what price?).&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;The expansion really makes this game shine.  I would not play the base game without it.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;Cooperative deck-builder to survive waves of attack (tactical/combat tower defense). Described like Starship Troopers.  Cards have too much text so I couldn&#39;t read them from a distance: others memorized them. Game requires mental arithmetic.  Game grew on me as it progressed. Wave 2 was more interesting.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#34;Looks spectacular. Gameplay is fun enough, and does the job in terms of attracting the family. Still looking for the &#39;perfect&#39; dexterity game, but as an occasional bit of fun, this does the job. Love this German carpentry!&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;Pretty good game choice for Halloween (if you have kids under 14)... drunken adults seem to like it, too. Pity the children.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;A nice filler - but you&#39;re completely at the mercy of the dice. Powers are a nice addition  - but with player elimination added to the mix, the game feels like it drags on sometimes.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;Owner : Benjamin Van den Sanden&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;We played this game incorrectly on my first play and barely scored any points but i could stilm tell this was going to be a great game and bought it that day. The way tiles are placed determine which resources every one gets. Then using those resources to purchase different scoring cards. The earlier you buy from a set of card the more valuable it is.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Clue is a classic detective game in itself.  It is unique and the later comers (e.g. Alibi) who try to replicate have failed.  It has an internal logic that sucks you into deep thought while it is tremendously fun to watch your Mr. and Ms walking around the house in every corner.  It is supposed to be a family game but most people find it too &#34;complicated&#34; for casual play.  It never becomes as popular even as pseudo-wargame like &#34;Risk&#34; who has a subject on war, a subject supposedly not appeal to the general public as much as a detective case on murder.  You ask questions and the one has the answer next to you passes the information ( a la card) he has on you.  By deleting the available information on hand by player, you deduct the final answers as to the place, killer weapon and the identity of the murderer, the cards of which were set aside before the game starts.  A simple fun game, as long as you can find players who are as obsessed by murders as you.&#39;, 3.),
 (&#34;Played with 6 - 8 player groups.  The game does not end at 7+  Way too many Neighs. This is the base game with two expansions. After 3 hours of playing, we usually just quit.  30-45 min is only for people who are unexperienced.  Have at least 5 heavy playing Magic players in my group. This can&#39;t be won/finished without extreme luck.  Have to modify the decks for it to be playable.  2/3 of neighs removed,  Search the deck cards limit to one of three draw piles.   Might have to institute rounds/cycles to limit the game time further.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;Very nice hack and slash game with so many game modes that is worth to keep in the collection probably forever :D&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;This is more a family game, maybe family+, as some smart bidding is required in order to win. As complexity it&#39;s of the same level as Pastiche. However, as a family game, I like it (it&#39;s with auctions :).&#34;, 7.),
 (&#34;An interesting and tactical football game.  I think it&#39;s the best of it&#39;s type.&#34;, 8.),

 (&#39;Own Core Set, 2017 (?) 2nd edition print (updated rulebook and some updated card designs). Rulebook could use improvement, and it would be better with some Round Phase reference cards.

 (&#39;Great! Lots of fun, easy rules!&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Mucho mejor de lo esperado, y por ahora solo he jugado en solitario. 8 partidas seguidas. Me recuerda a mi querido Viernes, pero más loco y difícil todavía.

 (&#39;Really cool game.&#39;, 10.),
 (&#39;생각보다 무척 짧고 의외로 할 수 있는 것이 적다.  그 와중에 최적을 찾는 퍼즐게임인 듯 싶다. Development가 단순한 석탄 캐는 게임에 다양함을 주는 것 같다.  약간의 고민과 계획한 바의 이루어짐을 직접적으로 느낄 수 있어 좋았다.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;It&#39;s not the abstract brain-burner that it appears to be.  Play moves quickly, a nice feeling of progression, nice tension.  A very solid design, people will still be raving about this years from now.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;Kickstarter with high hopes for it, but my oh my what a dicefest. Multiple abilities, but if you fail your single roll, the best ability is for naught, thus proper gameplay and calculation of propabilities demands use of only the standard abilities (which are cheaper). And seemingly endless long.  Boring. Waited more than a year, sold after only 3 plays. Big letdown. &#39;, 3.),
 (&#39;The artwork is amazing.  The production values are solid.  There\&#39;s certainly a lot of stuff you get in the box.  I do like the fact that resources remain on the board and are fair game if left unprotected.  That said, there isn\&#39;t one thing that this game does particularly well.  The economic game isn\&#39;t as good as other options.  The &#34;story&#34; is oddly slapped on lipstick.  The combat is meh.  The asymmetry isn\&#39;t really that interesting.  This game definitely could have used a lot less things and more refinement of some core concepts.&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;Interesting game! But the part where only some players are forced to pay for the crisis is not good&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Bought this at the UK Game Expo yesterday (31/05/08) from the Ragnar Brothers stand, after playing a game with Steve. Really enjoyed it. Thanks to Steve for sitting in and showing us how to play. Although this plays okay with two players it is much better with three (and presumably four).&#39;, 8.),

 (&#34;I&#39;d been looking forward to trying Jaipur; I&#39;m a big fan of Pauchon&#39;s Metropolys and generally like this kind of clever, quick 2p card game. But in the end I thought it was just OK. It&#39;s beautifully produced, very fast and there are some subtleties of timing, but I didn&#39;t find it as interesting as Traders of Carthage for a game of similar mechanics, length and decision density.&#34;, 5.),
 (&#34;To be honest I never gave it much of a chance but there just wasn&#39;t enough substance to keep my interest, even for a filler.   Cute pasted theme, easy to learn and play but as fluffy as a fur ball and luck driven.    Would make an alright non-gamer filler. &#34;, 5.),
 (&#39;Really hated this game.&#39;, 1.),

 (&#39;Very fun game found the rules very easy to learn but still very deep &#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;Very fun and very true to life.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Rating based on about 8 plays, the best moves seem obvious, but there is always a balance of setting up your counterattack while defending and other positional things to think about when playing. The more I play the more I like it and the more depth I feel there is, started out with lots of scrappy 0-0 games, but most recently had a 3-1 (loss) in 60 mins playing time. &#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;I love playing this game with my son! So much fun! It&#39;s amazing that it can be tactical but also be simple enough for my 9yo to pick up and really enjoy. So much so that he now asks for faction decks as rewards for good grades, etc. &#34;, 6.),

 (&#39;First couple plays about a month ago, and I really enjoyed it. Just enough mix of luck and screwage to go over well for our group. Went a bit long our first play, but by the 2nd game, we had it streamlined and it felt just right.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;This is a great party game that no one ever expects to be as fun is it turns out to be.  The concept is so easy and intuitive.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Began to play this in the 2-player variant - a good way to get used to what this game is actually about.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;THE GOOD:  1. Rated this game a 9 after the first play. This rating may go down after repeated plays and concerns about becoming stale with the current mix of cards. 2. Theme really shines in this game  THE BAD:  1.HATED the sort after opening, beginners or first time players of a deck builder are going to put it back in box and drop it off at goodwill.  2. Rule book could of been better (this can be said about a lot of rule books though). This goes along with #1: no explanation of sorting the decks out.  3. could they make the print any smaller for the different decks/objectives?   &#39;, 9.),

 (&#39;Lotsa fun for the kids. Beaten by my 4 and 6 year olds regularly.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Great spacial learning game with fairly deep strategy once played through several times. Rules are simple and straight-forward, and game play is quick. A fantastic filler game when waiting for more people to show up to events, and one that hits the table pretty often. Fans of Blockus or other abstract spatial games will find this to be a joy to play. Online updates to new boards [on boardgamegeek.com] keep the game fresh. &#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;who on earth are those two figures on the box. As a kid already, I wanted to know. Somehow I never understood the fuzz about this game.&#39;, 4.),
 (&#39;Not my favorite Knizia.  Play cards to stand in line.  It reminds me a bit of Kolejka, but without the cultural significance.&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;??&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;One of my all time favorites.  Yes, it is a little inaccurate in terms of physics.  It can also be a bit time consuming to design new vehicles from scratch.  I find it does play fairly quickly if players stick to stock designs, or design their vehicles ahead of time.  I have most all of the supplements from the early eighties through the early nineties.  I&#39;ve never played fifth edition.  &#34;, 7.),
 (&#34;Played it at 2 players and solo. The rules are pretty intuitive and there&#39;s iconography in every board and card to make it more helpful. It feels very puzzling since you have to really think through your actions for the round. You also have to keep in mind that you&#39;ll probably have to replan it all again if someone takes the spaces you wanted (therefore there can be some AP). There are a lot of different options for you to take, which it&#39;s nice. Also, there are several ways to alter the value of the dice to make your strategy work. It&#39;s a very enjoyable game. I would totally recommend it and will play it again.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;Played at Gamefest #1 in Milwaukee. Enjoyable game. Nice components. A little too simple for replay value.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Sometimes, you get a lot of mileage out of core mechanics, and 7 Wonders makes drafting into a game you can play over and over again. This rating is based on owning all the expansions to date, and getting even more plays in with the iOS app. The only downside for me is the massive amount of icons.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;Simple game and works well with young people. Gets really repetitive after time!&#39;, 7.),

 (&#39;Simple mad havoc. Best played with little toy cars!&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;In terms of dungeon crawlers, this game predates Descent, and has a very similar feel. However, Descent seems bloated compared to Doom. In Doom, setup is quick, the rules are relatively simple and the game plays smoothly without having to look up a lot of extra rules or game terms. It really shines as a fun, but difficult monster-masher game, and the retro video game theme is really fun.  Level 7 Omega Protocol shares a similar theme, and does many of the same things, so if I were to recommend picking up a single marines vs monsters dungeon crawl game, it would be that, but this does come in a close second, assuming you have access to both the base game and the expansion for doom.  :star: Art, Iconography and components functional :nostar: Clever or interesting mechanisms :star: Reasonably low downtime between turns with mildly AP players :star: Multiple plays stay interesting :nostar: Low or mitigatable luck elements :star::star::star::nostar::nostar: Raw enjoyment  Critical expansions:  [thing=20055][/thing]&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Have ony played it with 4. I recommend to play more than four or else you miss out on the debates. &#39;, 5.),
 (&#34;Fun. Actually didn&#39;t feel like Machi Koro at all, even though I see why the comparison is made. Seems to have a high replay value, especially with all the expansions out already. For some reason, though, it&#39;s not one I&#39;d like to play all the time.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;Amazing system.  Older ones are way better.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Laminated&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;I really like how elegant the mechanics in this game were. It played a little on the dry side, though.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;I have been playing this since my days at University. Love it! I have a couple different sets.  Classic strategy! Love this game!&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;&#34;Caylus light&#34; ain\&#39;t that light! It\&#39;s a good medium weight game, for those times when you desire Caylus, but don\&#39;t have enough time or the right people to play.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;A very nice game.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;One of the heavier/complex boardgames I own. I really enjoy playing this for all of the options it offers. I do not mind the aspect of possibly starving in the game. The biggest challenge is finding people that are willing to play this game.   Pros: I personally love all of the options. Cons: Too many options for some people. &#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;Love the deck building. Some of my friends get bored after the 300th game, but that&#39;s their problem.&#34;, 9.),
 (&#34;I don&#39;t enjoy playing this game. At the risk of repeating all of the other criticisms out there, here are my thoughts...  The biggest problem is the rules don&#39;t feel like give the players any choices or control at all -- you either explore a new tile and trigger a monster  and possible an encounter, or you trigger an encounter (even if you&#39;re actively engaged in combat.) The monsters and encounters often include unavoidable damage. Most powers become exhausted after a single use and don&#39;t reset until you  manage to get one of the very few dedicated cards that reset them (even resetting on a natural 20 would feel more balanced and exciting.) This means that you end up choosing between your at-will powers for almost the entire game. And to make it worse, most of the powers don&#39;t have enough of an effect to merit their use. For example, one power allows you to push back a monster, but this doesn&#39;t in any way limit the monster&#39;s ability to attack you when it activates in almost all cases. So you might have well just used the at will power with the highest bonus to hit.  Speaking of bonuses, the monsters power seems quite arbitrary. Kobold skirmishers have +9, which means they hit the most heavily armored character on a 6 or something close to that. Really strange.  Any game I&#39;ve played without the Cleric feels like punishment as opposed to a game. The items are unremarkable and often come with rules or limitations that make them feel weak.  The characters and their abilities are ripped right from the pages of D&amp;D source material, so that shouldn&#39;t disappoint.  The quality of the components varies. For instance, the encounter, treasure, and item cards are terribly bland with no art. The monster cards have some art and are ok. The highlight being the interlocking room tiles and the miniatures which are nice enough to justify the purchase if you can get it for under forty bones, which shouldn&#39;t be too difficult.&#34;, 4.),
 (&#39;I don\&#39;t know where my GeekBuddies are coming from on this one.  I think it\&#39;s the weakest of the series so far, with neither a compelling new mechanic nor enough control for my tastes.  As for playing well as a partnership game, I saw almost no way to usefully communicate with or help my partner, aside from normal &#34;watch the discards&#34; kind of information gathering.  Meh.  Where\&#39;s Jack the Ripper or Jeckyl and Hyde?&#39;, 4.),
 (&#39;Great game that every family should own.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;The big selling point of this game was the beautiful minis and the pure co-op &#34;Arcade&#34; mode. Although this mode doesn\&#39;t entirely bring everything you can want to the game, it does offer a quick and neat way of resolving conflict, that gets more intuitive with subsequent plays. Looking forward to the SDE: Legends expansion so this can have the campaign mode it so strongly requires. At the moment, a great dungeon crawl with an incredibly cute theme. &#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;Good game but for the price the cards with the game are some of the worst I&#39;ve ever seen.  They are paper thin and bend very easily.  I thought the quality could have been better.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;Silly mass market game that we have had fun with.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;I didn&#39;t know what to expect going in, but being as that I tend to usually like roll-and-writes, I wanted to check this out. The game is good, if maybe a few too many nooks and crannies thrown into one design. It&#39;s like someone looked at Qwixx and wondered why there weren&#39;t more ways to score. The end result feels like a very Feldian design, where you can score in a myriad of different ways, and oftentimes you&#39;ll combo different things that will give you a bunch of ways to score elsewhere. I guess it&#39;s pretty clever? I&#39;ve seen enough games do this to the point where it doesn&#39;t feel as warm and fuzzy as it once did...and I think that just because this is a roll-and-write doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s breaking any new ground. It&#39;s a pleasant enough game, but definitely not one I will seek out. Still probably in the top three roll-and-writes I&#39;ve played though.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;Fast passed word game where you string all your letters together to create a crossword looking thing. Really fun word game. Better than Scrabble but in the same vein. &#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;I preordered this game (and received some nifty resin bonus miniatures and terrain as a reward) and got it to the table not too soon after it arrived. We played two of the scenarios and while a few mistakes were made the first time around the second play went smoothly.  The game itself is a co-op with each player taking the role of one or more of the crew of the Firefly. There are only five roles available in the base game, though the word is that more will follow in the upcoming expansions.  The game pits the crew against a combination of goons (either thugs who are all about hand-to-hand combat or Cowboys who &#39;pack heat&#39; and will shoot when able) and uses a activation system based on &#39;moments&#39;. That is, each mission (referred to, in the spirit of the game as a &#39;job&#39;) runs for a certain number of moments before the job is deemed a bust.  Players use differing number of moments for their actions and then the player (or goon) furthest back on the moment track is activated. This works well but in a four player (and, I imagine a five player) game it can lead to a fair bit of downtime depending on where players are placed.  One nice touch is that players have the option of either acting casual or acting heroic. This determines not only what actions are available to them but also the way the goons will interact with them as well.  The game is good clean silly fun and has excellent production qualities.   A couple of weaknesses are that there are no &#39;boss&#39; style opponents and fighting the goons, even though there are five varieties of each, can get old fast. The other main weakness is that there are only four jobs included in the pack. I&#39;d expect a dozen to be the bare minimum but Gale Force Nine have advised that plenty more will be made available on-line soon.  Overall, a good fun co-op which does an excellent job in capturing the theme of this much-loved TV show. The Little Fish (aged nearly 8 and 5 and a half) though seemed to really like this and I can see it hitting the table again soon.  A winner.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#34;Anything can happen in this game. Don&#39;t count on your plans. The cards are unbalanced and mostly unfair. It&#39;s not more interesting than the regular Risk but worth trying anyway! Do all non-infantry units have to be war elephants..?  24.3.2008: Played the classic Risk variant with this game. Idiotic rules and weird balance issues appear again. But I won this one by conquering all the board and wiping the other three players entirely - so the game can&#39;t be THAT bad! (It still is.)&#34;, 4.),

 (&#39;01-08-2016 - Got this one in with the fam over New Years.  I really liked it a lot.  It\&#39;s not the best &#34;game&#34; in the world, the decisions you make often end up in pretty random results, but who cares?  It\&#39;s fun to put together your little village, go out exploring, and have little adventures with at least some kind of decision to make.

 (&#34;I enjoy the level of asymmetry int he game, but like most asymmetrical games it would take multiple plays to really enjoy it. Sadly it didn&#39;t quite rise to the level of fun to warrant enough plays to fully enjoy the various strategies.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#34;2 *** 5 *** 6 **  Ripper 0-3 Police --- Really enjoyable first game. Very nicely done deduction system, how it will stand up I&#39;m not sure but well worth a try.  With 6 players it seemed very hard for &#39;the ripper&#39; and we caught him on the second night. but still..  Looooong if it goes the full 4 nights. Maybe too long a game for what it is... Want to try it with 2 or 3 players as it could be a lot faster and more involving...  Much quicker with 2 but not as &#39;fun&#39;. I can imagine 3 (or, maybe, 4) being the best.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;Enjoy this dice game.  Usually family games. Obtained Jan. 2011 &#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;A perfectly cromulent deck-building game.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Real nifty game to play with friends. Not a big time commitment or anything hard. Good clean fun.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#34;Light and fun, with lots of theme.  Only downside is that there is nothing to do when it&#39;s not your turn (except heckle!), so it can feel a bit slow at times with 4 players.  Very enjoyable though and would happily play again.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;Game of allocating dice to different activities, to get provinces and people to place in those provinces. Not much in the way of varying strategies or getting an engine going; instead very tactical. Can be very frustrating as there is a fair amount of screwage from other players, and often the dice rolls are completely useless. Still, works well overall. &#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;A very long playing game based upon German elections. Plenty of decisions to be made. A real hit with me as I like both games and elections.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;Surprisingly well put together for a party game.  Every track has good and bad characters, so there is some combination effects.  My favorite part is how the modifier cards can point to anything in any picture on any card, offering a lot of creative freedom and humor, as well as creating the kind of recursive moral dilemma that comes up in real philosophical debates.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Protections cartes : MG standard.&#39;, 10.),
 (&#39;I very much like this game, which combines the best features of Settlers, Diplomacy, and Risk.  Has all the brain burn one wants, combined with the amusement of conflict and some backstabbing. The one downside is that there always seems to be someone who, at least at some point in the game, is in a demoralizing position. Would rate it higher if it could be played quicker.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Got rid of&#39;, 3.),
 (&#39;6.1.2008: A simple card game that offer some cooperation and traitor elements.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;Legacy aspect is cool and has some new twists, but at it&#39;s core it&#39;s still just Risk.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;I wanted to like this game more, but it was just too Euro for me.  &#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Curiously this reminds me of Tigris &amp; Euphrate in that after reading the rules I was thoroughly confused.  However a few minutes of playing it and all was revealed.  This is a nice little filler game.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Always a hit.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;BIG board. Nice pieces. Overall fun game.  Sometimes a bit too big to get to the table!&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;impressed with this game, can&#39;t really tell if there are balance issues, fun to play but slightly long for what is going on,&#34;, 8.),
 (&#34;It&#39;s a four player game.  Period.  With six it is a torturous exercise in futility because you can&#39;t have any strategy since bombs are more numerous than turds in a litter box in a house with six cats.  [b]Update[/b]: I was taught to play with two decks when there are six players. Whoops.  I think playing with just one deck would make the game even longer, which is scary, since there are fewer points each hand...&#34;, 8.),
 (&#34;This game left me feeling flat.  I &#39;lived&#39; out my life, but it was in the same way of min/maxing the cards that were good to me vs what wasn&#39;t compared to the other players that felt like there was no soul.    And unlike other soulless games, this one takes a bit longer. &#34;, 3.),
 (&#34;Great mechanics, but for me it felt that the theme didn&#39;t rise out of them in the slightest. Big fan of Jamey&#39;s other games but this one didn&#39;t sing. &#34;, 6.),
 (&#34;Light bluffing game.  Very social.  LOVE the bags with the snaps, way to fit out a game!  Downsides:  It&#39;s hard on those with bad poker faces (like myself). It&#39;ll be annoying to play with couples who never challenge each other.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;So much to think about!  Simple rules, tons of choices.  Brilliant design.  Different than other games.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;I think we mostly like saying &#34;BRAAAAAWWWGGGGG&#34; when we turn the statues.   A neat little deduction-type game, a bit tough to teach, but fun once it\&#39;s understood. It\&#39;s not complicated enough that severe AP sets in, though a little AP can occur when trying to plan out a complicated move. &#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Enjoyable fairly quick playing game. I just have the feeling that the game gets too easy quite quickly.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Fun theme, but the dread pirate causes a runaway leader problem and the only competition seems to be figuring out who will come in second.&#39;, 4.),
 (&#39;One of the few ameritrashy games I really liked playing.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Rated after one play.  Fun game for the first two hours...after that it seemed to drag.&#39;, 5.),

 (&#34;Yeah, It&#39;s fun. Once., Maybe twice. No more.&#34;, 4.),
 (&#39;rated to offset the designer rating her own games&#39;, 1.),
 (&#39;This is a great game! Fantastic replayability and good social deduction mechanics.   Warning though: Since this game depends heavily on the group that is playing, do think carefully about group dynamics before introducing it. For instance, some folks may be uncomfortable with lying and will really dislike this. Also, I would avoid playing this game with your spouse if he/she will take offense if you try to lie to him/her in this game. &#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;Setting aside the pasted-on theme, this is really an abstract game.  The challenge is to cover spaces on the board strategically using the cards you&#39;re dealt, and then the cards you purchase as the game goes on.  Landscape tiles match the board and score points, while the livestock cards are used to surround markets and get you money.  While there&#39;s nothing inherently wrong with the game, it just feels too much like other games I&#39;ve tried and doesn&#39;t have a unique hook to keep me coming back for more plays.  Given the choice of a hexagonal tile-laying game with cards, I&#39;d much prefer to play Kingdom Builder.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;Very good first game. Could become a classic for four players game in this segment. Do not expect a detailed historical simulation but the ambiance is there.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;Yuck&#39;, 1.),
 (&#39;An excellent engine building game that plays within an hour with three players. I wish they had used a smaller box, but they probably wanted to appeal to the Russian Railroads crowd picking a RR sized box.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Wow, this game took me back to 1979 and my first D &amp; D boxed set. Simple but elegant.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;This game is great if you enjoy Christian themed games, plus if you are a fan of magic, but do not enjoy the magic part of it, this is the game for you. A very good system for a battle card game. &#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;It&#39;s not my cup of tea, the randomness of the fire is good because we never know where the fire will spread in real life, but the game look likes Pandemic a little better.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;Played the initial scenario twice as of ranking. Story games are not high on my desire list, hence the lower rank. However, my son and I really enjoyed our time together playing this. We will definitely continue to play it. Though we might wait for the professional narration before doing the other scenarios.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Easily my favorite board game.  I like how tight the game is, and how competitive it manages to be despite having no &#34;direct&#34; interaction.  Works well for all numbers of players it supports.  Accessible theme.  Great components.  Cards make it endlessly replayable.&#39;, 10.),
 (&#39;I feel this game is rated way too low. &#39;, 5.),
 (&#34;This is the best Risk I have played so far. It become a race of survival, because the walkers can and will take over the map in no time.  Our first game, we attacked between ourself like normal but in no time the walkers overrun change that. When the game ended there were about115 walkers, my wife had 24 survivals and I had only 8 troops left. events can be repetitive but they add a little more spice to the game. Overall a great game, I can&#39;t wait to have a 3-4 game soon. &#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;An unhappy KS campaign risks hiding a grman masterpiece... it would be a shame because the game is amazing, with solid mechanics, high interaction, difficult choices and lots of contentment! A very good game!&#39;, 9.),
 (&#34;I really enjoy getting this game out.  There is certainly some luck involved so don&#39;t go in thinking that if you are the best player you are guaranteed to win.  But it is light, fun, and great with the right crowd.  IMHO this is 5 player only for me.  I would certainly not do it with 3, and even 4 would not be optimal.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#34;Nice Carcassonne/Entdecker cross, but doesn&#39;t grab me much.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;short simple game for two - makes fun /*#G5*//*stay*/&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;I like that although there&#39;s a lot of randomness in [b][thing=171623][/thing][/b], most of it is in the set up and once set up, the only other bit is the dice and how the contracts come out. And the randomness of both is mitigated by, for the dice, using camels to re-roll or modify them, and for the contracts, by there being six available each turn. It&#39;s very rare that all the available contracts are unappealing.  The random board layout makes each game feel just a bit different. Some games money is plentiful and other times it&#39;s very tight. Some games, travel is easy as there are locations and contracts that give movement points aplenty, and some games there aren&#39;t. In other games, VPs can be made in cities, and other games, VPs are primarily from contracts. Which means each play there&#39;s a different optimum strategy (which may or may not have to be flexible given what other players are doing).&#34;, 9.),
 (&#39;Rules make it unplayable. Needed an updated version of the rulebook.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;k6&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Great game&#39;, 10.),
 (&#39;There is alot to like about this game. The card system is very interesting and everything that you do in the game feels rewarding. The scoring is a bit confusing for new players but overall a very rewarding game.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;Good system.  Quick and easy to learn and play.  Turks get their butts kicked every time.&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;scales well from 2players to larger groups. Fairly quick, but filled with lots of interesting strategy. Fairly easy to learn, once you get past the learning curve of the symbology. Very nice space theme. LOTS of replay-ability!&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;Excellent light and fun card game. Cards are of high quality but I wish the number of each card was written in all 4 corners instead the 2 &#34;top&#34; ones.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Not bad good first impression i thought the two player mod sucked though so we just passed cards around and it was really fun.  The tile laying aspect really makes it intricate&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Have only played with expansions. Great game.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#34;Definitely a hit with my children.  This is basically a matching / Uno style game with the added joy of making animal sounds (or trying not to) when playing cards.  My young children really enjoy it and we have played it well over 20 times.                                                                                                                                                                                 I would not be suggesting this game for a gamer&#39;s group; it&#39;s definitely a children&#39;s game and is good for matching / turn taking / etc learning.&#34;, 6.),

 (&#39;Simple, portable, short and cheap, but kinda plays itself. Still better than most deck builder around.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;A good combo of strategy and deduction. Starts to get predictable after a few games with the same opponent though.&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;This is simply the best LCG out on the market. Regarding the data packs, the core box, the rules, the game play and especially the play time and complexity!  Update 11.11.18 to 3: I do not have the time for a LCG anymore. Will not play this ever again.&#39;, 3.),
 (&#39;Expansions / Upgrades: - Peloton&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;If you are ok with the application usage this is a great game. It’s a campaign mode game so you need specific party to play through it. Very enjoyable up to now.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;An excellent quick game, this is easy to learn, fun to play, strategic, and fast. Recommended for serious gamers and casual players alike.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Thoroughly enjoyable game, lovely models and a good mechanism.  Just wish I could manage to stay in the air in a game occasionally.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Set Collection&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;10-01-2018 (290)&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Destroyed in flood.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Works very well as a solo game. Highly recommended for Uwe fanboys.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;The theme is great.  There is a hefty dose of fiddliness with this game, so you really need one guy &#34;running it&#34; to make everything go down smooth.  Punching Nazis has never been more fun.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Great game of being a frontiersman, while on the surface the game seems complicated, once you actually start playing everything makes sense and works together well.  The limited resources on the board and small space you have on your character make you have to plan what you want to do, excellent game.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;Not bad for what it tries to be, especially considering its age.&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;Charming family game.  Very high luck factor combined with unbalanced victory point cards overwhelms any opportunity for skillful play, but it is still an enjoyable, quick exercise.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;It all comes down to who first draws an expensive building - no way to catch up!&#39;, 6.),

 (&#39;Great bits and an OK game, but Pizza Box is significantly better&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;10.14.13 Great game. Play this on iOS a lot. Don&#39;t seem to get tired of it though I prefer Europe to USA.   (25 iOS plays)&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;Draw cards, play cards, buy/sell your wares to earn 60 gold to win! Very fun game, and each player has the abililty to play cards that will give him/her the advantage, or play cards to hinder the opponent. I recommend this game&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Great gateway game, need to try eastern wonders. &#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;It&#39;s fine, it&#39;s munchkin. Not a huge fan but not bad.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;Played at Salt Con.  I rather enjoyed this one after we digested the rules (all new players to the game).  Like any interaction-heavy game, this requires involvement from the &#34;right&#34; group of players but can be very fun given that context.  I could see this having long-term legs, but I may not ever end up playing again too.  So we\&#39;ll see and adjust this rating accordingly.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Good concept, but I think this needs to be played with the expansion, else it can go too long.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6dqHVEi_Es  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlsAHYV5VVM&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Nice, simple Eurogame good for beginners or for when you have an extra 30 minutes.  Great art by Michael Menzel.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;The lack of information that players have in this game is second to none; most of the time you won’t even know what card you have, let alone those that your opponents are holding. Even small amounts of info can be key, following where a card has gone can give you enough information to make semi-informed decisions and that can be the difference between winning and losing.  The sheer number of roles and the number of players that this game can support is fantastic, a great party game for people who don’t mind a good dose of chaos.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;This game was fired by Rallyman GT. Traded 6/20&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;+Percimol Rules&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;Fun game. Tense. The splitting of the cards can take a little long, but I don&#39;t mind the longer turns in this game.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;Not sure about long-term appeal. Nice family game&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;The first time we played this game it was a disaster, as a rules conflict caused an argument and some hurt feelings. After that it was almost two years before we tried to play it again.  Now we really enjoy it. It\&#39;s may be my favorite &#34;battle&#34; game, as despite it\&#39;s apparently combative nature, the winning conditions are varied, and there is some strategy to decisions. It still has a bit more luck than I usually like, but somehow it almost always gets pulled out when it\&#39;s late, almost everyone has already gone home, and the remaining few just want one more game.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#34;Hilarious party game that doesn&#39;t really require any skill at all, just a bit of imagination&#34;, 6.),
 (&#34;Both, Splendor and this, do not blow my mind and I&#39;m more often than not *not* in the mood to play them. Objectively both are good. I think I prefer the snowballing effect in Splendor, also the golden Poker chip reserve mechanism.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;Very little downtime as you increase the amount of players. Quick and easy to pickup, but enough there to be enjoyable.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#34;I have only played once.  When I read the rules, I did not see a game here.  It seemed too simple.  Fortunately, it works very well in practice, and I really like that I was able to turn some really moronic plays in the first part of the game into a better position at the end.  I have played a couple more times now.  I kind of like the fact that you have to plan your approach based on where you are in the seating order.  Since if you are near the end of the round, you can expect to either pay alot or resign yourself to a lower card.  I will have to try the game with the original rules that allow you to meet the previous bid to see if I like that better, but it doesn&#39;t really sound as interesting that way.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#34;A little abstract spatial card game, but it&#39;s really about set collection. I love the tiles and the art, and it&#39;s mostly a friendly, relaxing game, without much interaction. Leave plenty of room to lay out the cards, because moving them around is a challenge.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#34;Can&#39;t help it.  It&#39;s just fun.&#34;, 10.),
 (&#39;Word association party game which is fine for what it is, but not particularly funny or exciting as some other similar games.&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;New - Still in shrink&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;I&#39;ve only played this a couple of times but it is on my wishlist and if I ever get it, I can see it coming to the table a lot.    It plays large numbers of players, doesn&#39;t last too long and causes a certain amount of rowdiness.  What better to bring a group together at the end of an evening or weekend?&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;This never gained as much traction as I thought it would (my kids are huge Nodwick fans).  It is hard to remember to bother with the timer.&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;This game is beautiful to look at, and a lot of fun to play.  The building tiles upon which victory is based are rather too easy to acquire, in my humble estimation.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;we had a lot of fun with this, before we found better games.&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;Első társasjátékom!:) Rövid, gyors játékmenet, kevés holtidő 4 játékosnál. Könnyű megtanulni az alapokat, azonban itt is vannak részletek, amelyekre érdemes odafigyelni.

 (&#39;Interesting concepts, played three player, would be good to try four player - play as two teams.  Marred slightly by random dice that decide the colours you draw.&#39;, 7.),

 (&#39;Enjoyed my first couple of games I have played.  I look forward to playing more.  Quick moving game with lots to think about with the added exitement of the push your luck element.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;Cool theme. Components are kind of meh. I am going to try the, stand alone, solo missions.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;The rules are badly written; it took several games and lots of forum searching to get it right. I really don&#39;t like deck-builders, and for a solo this game has way too much luck involved. What makes it worse is that it feels too long for what it is.  And the shuffling . i hate it.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;A light wargame with great components. The luck factor plays its part, but there is also a major place for strategies. The expansions add more strategy and the luck factor is reduced.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Horrible, clunky system, lacking in any sort of reasonable granularity. Large turn order binding. Will never play again.&#39;, 2.),
 (&#39;This game is a broken mess. All the more disappointing because I can see a game I want to play, but it unfortunately never materializes. The rulebook is awful.   There should be a lot more time before the haunt kicks in. The game has no balance. It’s completely half-assed. So almost all of the fun is ruined for both sides because the exploring is always rushed and the haunt is usually completely unbalanced.   The group consensus is that it would have been nice if the designers could have updated the broken parts of the original  game. &#39;, 3.),
 (&#34;Unlock! Squeek and Sausage is a cooperative escape room-style game that&#39;s all contained in a single deck of cards (and a mobile app). Like other games in this genre, this game is meant to be played through only once, though no components are destroyed and the game can be played by another group.  In this scenario, you&#39;ve been imprisoned by some sort of mad clown, and you&#39;re interacting with his bizarre lair trying to stop him from blowing up the world or something.  So, many of the things you do are a little oddball.  Like in The Formula though, the puzzles are interesting and generally well done.  The numbers that you&#39;re supposed to find on the cards are more visible too.  Of the three original scenarios, I found this one to be the easiest, but that didn&#39;t make it less satisfying.

It would have been awesome that they could have use some wooden disks with silkscreen on it with images that could have convey the theme better (but I know this would have increase the costs). -- The printing on the rule book and the board is a little bit sub par (the surface is rough instead of being smooth). -- I hate having to put sticker on game parts (but I know why they do it instead of printing on the parts).   :arrowE: [b]OTHER GAME INFO:[/b] [b] Game Weight = 3.1/5 Release Date = 2011 Number of Player = 2-4 2-player length = 60 min.

 (&#34;Nice theme, but poor production quality - the player boards and the art on some cards are just awful.  A bit too boring and luck dependent. Too much accounting and book keeping which doesn&#39;t feel necessary or elegant.

 (&#34;This is a very fun game, that would be good for families, as it&#39;s easy to play, looks great, and is fun to play. It&#39;s also a lot of fun for gamers too.  The components for this one are just awesome. It doesn&#39;t get much better than this, with the plastic bottles, plastic gems, metal frying pans, thick cardboard chits and the little stoves, with temperature dials. They really did a good job on this one.  Game play is simple and a lot of fun. Check it out. This is a cool light game.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;2020-06-24  Initial Rating: 7.0 (June 2020)  I love Summoner Wars and last month I played Ashes: Rise of the Phoenixborn and I liked it as well, so I was very keen to try another 2 player game from Plaid Hat Games and (in this case) designer Colby Dauch. Sadly, even though the game began very strong for me, at the end I was kind of bored.  Crystal Clans´ rules are easy to teach. You can do it under 7 minutes. Playtime is around 100 minutes which is too long.  The theme is kind of nice, but the story in the rulebook is rather weak. The theme is very thin and you don´t feel it when you play the game, but I don’t care about theme if the game has good mechanisms (Crystal Clans doesn’t).  The art is merely ok, I don’t really like it (Summoner Wars art is also regular but I love the game) while I do love the art in Ashes: Rise of the Phoenixborn.  Just like the other games by from Plaid Hat Games, there are lots of options to choose from before you begin playing and the decks came already assembled (which is great). Just like Summoner Wars, each deck has 3 champions (called Heroes here) and the rest are common units (there are no events). I like this.   Gameplay is fun at the beginning. To do any action you have to first pay the cost and each time you pay the cost, you give that amount of energy to your opponent, so if you play cheap cards, your opponent will have few energy in his turn, if you play big cards, your opponent will have enough energy to play big cards as well, this also means that if you have lots of energy, you can play several times in a row until you run out of energy.  I LOVE this, this is the best facet of the game.  Each player can summon units to the board, but you can have at most 3 units in the same space. There is a stacking mechanism which sounds great on paper, but it is a hassle in real life as you have to constantly reorganize the cards each time you move them. Also there is a faction that can ignore this rule (obviously), the Blood Clan, and they can have stack much more bigger than 3, so this part is rather boring having to reorganize constantly the stacks during the game. After you have units on the board you can move them and you can attack with them. The combat system is very boring, you simply sum the amount of attack you have in your stack and then you compare it with the defense of the opponent’s units. You kill the units which have less shields than your attack from top to bottom, your opponent does the same and the wounds are dealt at the same time. Players also play a facedown card to affect the combat, but this part revolves around a boring rock-paper-scissor scheme and the end result is random. I VASTLY prefer to roll dice In which the odds are clearly and easily calculated, in Crystal Cavern the hidden cards can have a HUGE impact in the battle or they can do nothing and it is worse if you don´t have cards in hand as in that case you play the first card from your deck and you get a random effect (as you never saw it). I don´t like uncontrollable luck in games, but I do love to throw dice in cmoabt games (and the odds are easily calculable so it isn´t really uncontrollable), and I miss them here.  The goal of the game is not to kill your opponent and I also think I don’t like this. The goal here is to be the first to have 4 Crystals and you get them (mainly) by controlling 2 out of 3 key spaces on the board (the board size is 9, so it is very small). Once you do so, you can buy a crystal out of 3. All the crystals have an effect and they appear randomly (I dislike this). Some crystal are clearly more powerful than others, other are much more situational so there is a lot of uncontrollable luck here. The other way to acquire a Crystal is to deplete your opponent’s deck and trigger a shuffle to draw a new card.  We played with the Blood Clan, which has weak units, but they can stack in numbers greater than 3, still I found them to be rather weak. They die very easily and you need much more skill to play them than I anticipated. We also played with Meteor Clan which has VERY strong units, albeit they are very costly, but 3 of these units are more than a match that 8 of the Blood Clan Units. Just like Summoner Wars, I guess the different factions have different style of play so I won´t accuse the game of being unbalanced but I felt the Blood Clan has a much harder time winning than the Meteor Clan.  I think there is a deckbuilding option, but those rules weren’t explained to me. I do like the option exists.  Bottom line, I was expecting great things from Crystal Clans, but I found a mediocre game. Combat is boring (the main culprit), without tension and random with the rock-paper-scissor mechanism. I also dislike the fact that your goal is not to kill your opponent (this is very personal though, not a minus against the game). I miss throwing dice in tactical 2 player games, who would have guessed? The energy system (I´m not sure it is called this way) is brilliant and the best the game has to offer. Perhaps with more plays the game could grow on me and I have a small curiosity about the other factions, but my desire to play the game remains low so I will sell it ASAP. I could probably play it in the future in the opportunity arises.   Current Rating: 5.0&#39;, 5.),

 (&#39;Fun game of chaotic game play that plays great with the right group. Can sometimes drag and players can feel out of it, so players need to be ok with not winning and playing the role of spoiler.&#39;, 7.),

 (&#34;Game that unfortunately suffered from marketing and target audience problems, but with a lot of potential, especially for scenario play.  Hint of a interesting backstory, which has always been one of my favorite things about Dan Verssen&#39;s games.  With the limited decks we have, games can quickly become stale, so play only from time to time.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;Better than average simulation about a little known period. Interesting for both players, even I found the random entry of the Hittite King too luck dependent.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Não é um jogo que me agradou muito. Ele é divertido com 5+ pessoas. Porém acho meio frustrante a questão de player elimination, principalmente se você for um dos primeiros a morrer, tendo em vista que o jogo leva uns 20 minutos com mesa cheia. O Coup também tem eliminação de jogador, mas o blefe está muito mais presente nele do que aqui no Bang.&#39;, 7.),

 (&#34;Based on 1 play. I wouldn&#39;t say Citadels is UNbalanced, but the mechanics do not have a buffer to prevent IMbalanced, frustrating, unfair play. Namely, the 1st player was King for 5 straight rounds, through choosing it and it being the 1 buried role. This inability to change start player leads to inequitable and inferior play. While I can accept this design flaw, I do note it and how it decreases the quality of the game. Would like to play again to get a different session to base opinions on.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;A simple and teachable turnless game.  It is totally true that this game swings wildly from the rapid-fire &#34;as fast as you can&#34; opening to the slower and ponderous conclusion.  You really can feel when the game is over.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;It is a simple game that is easy to learn.  The age rating for this game can be for as low as 6 year olds because you don&#39;t even need to know English to really learn the game.  It is awesome because you can just flip the cards over and you now have a regular deck of 52 cards.&#34;, 10.),
 (&#34;What a letdown!  I liked RRD.  I really liked RRD-D.  I thought I&#39;d love RRD-2 but no such luck.  The game opens well but seems to have a real runaway leader problem.  Guess I&#39;ll have to stick to RRD-D.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#34;Players are company owners, producing goods in the region of Indonesia, and shipping them off to nearby cities for profit.  Players take turns auctioning off player order, acquiring shipping and goods companies, gaining special powers, proposing company mergers, and operating these companies to try and turn a profit.  Goods companies produce stuff, shipping companies move it to market, and each skims some profit to the company owners.  Anybody (within reason) can propose a merger of any two companies on the board, irrespective of ownership, and a bidding war begins.  A luck free, brutal business game for the players who like that sort of thing (18xx players, I guess).  There is nothing particularly difficult about the rules, however the concepts and decisions you&#39;re faced with are mind numbing.  Experienced players will destroy the newbies.  Excellent game, with a caveat - you must like business games (and maths).&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;Very luck dependant, and luck can frustrate your plans, so a little annoying. Good theme and intense.  Edit: After more matches, game time decreases and all have more sense. Luck is not so a problem if you search only for a tense and demanding experience. More tactical than Arkham Horror.  Edit 2: More matches and luck is again frustrating. Definitve score, I think.&#39;, 4.),
 (&#39;Puerto Rico kaartspel New in collection jan. 08 Bought from Lajos. If you\&#39;re in for Puerto Rico, but don\&#39;t want the setup-time, this is an &#34;almost there&#34; alternative.  For me this game is totally obsolete after 2 years: it doesn\&#39;t come close to the experience of Puerto Rico (the boardgame), and after I played Race for the Galaxy I never played this again.  Now I\&#39;ve found Glory to Rome which is way better than Race for the Galaxy, so where does it leave this?  Only reason for keeping this is I might take this along to holidays, bars etc. because I wouldn\&#39;t want to take my rare Glory to Rome along. Oh, and it would do a nice job of being the gateway to this &#34;multiple use of cards&#34; kinda game.&#39;, 5.),

 (&#34;[FAMILY GAME]  THE perfect travel game (most practical format I&#39;ve ever seen!) - and rated as such. Of course not the most complexe game of all, but for what it is it is still profound enough to entertain very well for a few moments, even on a table as small as the ones on a plane. That&#39;s all it wants - and all we want ;-) To heighten tactics we are playing with three cards in hand though.       &#34;, 9.),
 (&#34;I played this game and it&#39;s a complete ripoff of Words With Friends. Who do these people think they are?&#34;, 6.),
 (&#34;Boy, what a heartbreaker. I&#39;d been looking forward to this for so long. As soon as we got the chance to play, it was on the table. Yuck. There is none of the angst that you get from Paths of Glory here, there are no tough decisions, all of your choices feel obvious and straight forward. I never felt the tension of whether to play my cards as actions or as CPs, either the card was great for me or it was an obvious CP move. Playing the pope was dreadfully dull. There weren&#39;t a staggering amount of choices, and those that you do make all are completely resolved by rolling tons of dice.  It never seems worthwhile to debate as you can spend your own CPs to lose territory. The first four turns seemed overwhelmingly clear and laid out for everyone involved (except perhaps the Hapsburgs). I almost feel like you just shouldn&#39;t bother with the protestants and just take keys for the auto-win. Even spending all your CPs on building the cathedral seems like a better option.  I traded places with the Ottoman player halfway through turn 3 hoping for some excitement and we both were let down by the real lack of worthwhile options available to us.  The first half of the game is so static. By turn 4 there is some difference in the board, but it seems like there is so much effort going on, and so much time committed for such little return.  There is a great sense of history here, and there is some wonderful chrome, but where is the game?&#34;, 2.),
 (&#34;Love this game - always want to play again. It&#39;s like an interactive interlocking puzzle with just the right amount of player interaction for me. Other players moves do affect you a bit but they don&#39;t totally block you. The game doesn&#39;t overstay its welcome or feel like you&#39;ve run a full-length brain marathon by the end whilst still being very strategically engaging. &#34;, 10.),
 (&#39;This is an &#34;in your face&#34; take that card game where you can be destroyed by a single &#34;twist&#34; card. That said, it played quickly and is great fun with the right players who can roll with the punches as well as dish out damage.&#39;, 6.),

 (&#39;Both games give the flavour and the taste of the battles as they were fought. It seems to watch the battles in progress, moreover if you saw films on this topic.

 (&#39;This was a lot of fun, though the horrible rulebook caused far too much confusion in the first couple of rounds. As with most first plays, I wish I had better understood the paths to victory early in the game--my lack of military might led to a lack of city tiles, which lead to a narrow loss.   Next time I play this, I look forward to more active table talk and trading of the various currencies AND favors! &#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Decent game for 2 people, easy to set up and play.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;I felt that the &#34;teleporting&#34; chits were overpowered and the board fairly useless. All in all a slightly more complicated trading game than bohnanza without a great deal of extra depth. Having said that it was enjoyable but simply didn\&#39;t grab my interest enough for a higher rating.&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;A subtle game where the two sides play very differently.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;The patching is brilliant, unfortunately the rest of the game just doesn&#39;t live up to it. Additionally 120 minutes is not realistic. 60 minutes is just ridiculous.  60 minutes would leave 4 minutes per turn.&#34;, 5.),
 (&#39;I think this is my favorite works well from 2 to 4 players. I enjoy press your luck games and this does that well, while having more decisions then the other games in the express line.  smell: ----:(---------- &#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Stefan Feld games first develop mechanics and then gets theme enacted (Greets to Dr.Knizia). However this game holds so many actions as big as pacific ocean is. Ok, we had an experienced 4 player game, so i will have to taste it with 1 or 2 less players in future. The rules need good 30 minutes to explain and you must fight against the snooze to the end of explanation. There is a small risk, when you rolled 3 bad dice rolls in a row (1, 2 or 3´s), so you can´t really change that effective without help of the purple Joker-God or with help of sacrifice needing white guardian-angel. So these -bad-dice rolls needs other gaming solutions. Perhaps temple occupation or island hopping? Now with great help of the orange god tiles. Included.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;Didn&#39;t become a classic by accident.&#34;, 9.),
 (&#34;This is maybe the best tactical board game I ever played. Reminds me the glorious Ufo and X-com videogames with several elements of Aliens movie saga. This game has all that fabulous things like deep tactical movement, power armor, exoskeleton and psionic powers(in the expansions) many many weapons and stuff to use in combat as you level up and so more..... Its a very fun game and game mechanics works well but the dice results is ever important...bad luck means bad things happens? It&#39;s the only game that capture the feeling of the tactical battles of Xcom.   Very thrilling atmosphere and very fun game, even solo is not too hard too track 3 or 4 characters. Game lenght very variable from mission to mission.  Components and miniatures are nice!  Own all expansions!  Reccomended if you love xcom and aliens saga.&#34;, 10.),
 (&#34;This is easier to get to the table than Race because the dice are a more compelling conceit. However, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s as much strategy here and think the development cards offer a whole lot less variability than the those in Race. &#34;, 8.),

 (&#39;Also have the 2012 Fantasy Flight Nexus Ops&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Clans is a simple, short abstract game. Player colours are kept hidden, and everyone can move all pieces on the board. It had a bit of deduction when trying to figure out who is playing which colour, a bit of bluffing when trying to keep the other players from doing just that, and a lot of tactical manoeuveringin order to get your clan in front without being too obvious about it. Clans is one of very few Colovini games I enjoy.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;Long term plans mean nothing in this one because the board dynamic changes so quickly.  But it makes it all the more sweet when you can adapt to those changes and slap your opponents down with your clever thinking.  I learn something new every time I play. Can&#39;t wait to bring it out again.  I&#39;ve just recently downgraded this from a 10 to a 9.  I still really like it...it&#39;s just that there are games that I&#39;d pick over this right now.&#34;, 9.),

 (&#39;This is heavily dice dependent, unbalanced and I love it. The game is probably a 7, the toys are a 9.5. Non-collectability is a major plus. Lego-esq landscape is worth the price of admission for battle tech freaks or other similar games.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;A mix between 7 Wonders (drafting) and Suburbia (tile placement).  I don&#39;t like the way disasters work with in base rules.  See the designer&#39;s thread in the &#39;Variants&#39; section for better alternatives.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;Very cool game, great counters, great map and interesting rules, and I did get some playing time in the other day and enjoyed it very much.   After a couple more games played, my ranking is going up on this one. There are so many options for both sides to consider. Great game!&#39;, 9.),
 (&#34;We got a chance to play this for the first time in a couple of years (with a higher play count of 4), and I enjoyed it more than I remember. It&#39;s easy, fairly quick, and has enough depth to make it worthy of a collection. Not surprisingly the Queen Games edition we have was missing 10 blue houses.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;Glory to Rome is about finding the most game breaking comboes in a deck filled with overpowered cards. Lots of very interesting card interactions, that just get more and more wild as the game goes on. This a game that never fails to entertain me, but I know the chaotic gameplay would not be for everyone.  While I like the minimalistic art of the new edition, the cartoony art of the original is totally servicable and is actually easier to parse. A real shame that both editions are so hard to find.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Very funny!&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;NIce bidding game, relatively quick&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;2020-01-22 - 6 - It\&#39;s an OK card game about getting resources and trading them to points, although I was hoping for something better. I\&#39;m not a fan of &#34;here is your 8 cards for the whole game, no more, no less and the number of them must be 8&#34;.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;He he - a guy at the top of the comments list wrote &#34;Great modules and a fun RPG, a bit difficult to design your own senarios in the system though. &#34; He must be thinking of the role playing game of the same name - not this game.  Funnily the name was the one reason I bought this. However, it turned out to be near unplayable and I sold it off quickly.&#39;, 2.),

 (&#34;Great large group party game, no question. (Unless you&#39;re stuck with a bunch of fuddy-duddies.)&#34;, 7.),
 (&#34;whatever.   another &#39;ok&#39; game. played too many average games to get excited about this kind of thing.&#34;, 4.),
 (&#39;Played this too many times to count.  All time favorite, I think.  Moved to Anniversary Edition. &#39;, 10.),
 (&#34;Cool idea for using cards and simulating the production and market. In saying simulating, its meant as a abstracted and not meant as real-life simulation. One should always keep his eyes on opponents and know if the game might end so, he could get his long-buildup engine to earn him some money. There&#39;s several strategies on how to approach it - go for solo and try to maximize it, or find the best factories of opponents and try to ride those to victory. You should try it!&#34;, 6.),

 (&#39;Very good Auction/Set collection game. Everyone has enjoyed every game so far.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#34;I really like how the different players each have different goals to win that interact but don&#39;t directly compete.  Makes the game very interesting!&#34;, 9.),
 (&#39;Ridiculously fun dexterity game.  A big hit with my 5 year old and he can beat the adults, too!&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Két okból vettem meg: olcsón jutottam hozzá, és magasan volt rangsorolva. Nos, nem okozott katarzist, de jól össze van rakva, és végül is szórakoztató volt. Hogy mondják? Nagyon jó iparos munka, de nem korszakos alkotás. Szerintem. A szabályok egyszerűek, de a sok döntési lehetőség miatt agyalós a játék. Művészeket kell a palotánkba csalni Firenzében, a mecénások korában, és úgy építkezni, hogy minél idillibb környezetben alkothassák meg főművüket, hogy az ezáltal minél értékesebb legyen. A játék hibája szerintem, hogy 7 kör van, így nincs olyan játékosszám, ami esetén mindenki azonos számú körben kezdő. Ennek fokozása, hogy 2 játékosnál a játék legelején elveheti a kezdőjátékos azt a szabadságjog lapkát, amiből 1 van, így a másik végig nem tud szerezni a játék során (megjegyzem ettől még nem a kezdő nyert esetünkben). Sok eltérő stratégia is eredményes lehet, a fent említett hiba ellenére is elég kiegyensúlyozottnak tűnik játék! Mindenre nem lehet egyszerre ráhajtani, hisz összesen 21 dolgot (épület, kártya, liget, stb.) szerezhetünk, de összesen több, mint 10 félét. Könnyen elmehet a dolog hosszadalmas optimalizálgatás irányába, szóval meg kell gondolni, kivel játszunk:) Én a presztízskártyát sokkal erősebbnek érzem, mint a bónuszt, bár kockázatosabb. Az átcsábító kártyának nem sok értelmét láttuk,de nyilván azért, mert kettőnknek jutott minden féle épület.  Nagyon sokat számít, hogy jókor kezdjük átváltani a művekért kapott pénzt győzelmi pontra! A nyelvfüggő kártyák még németül sem okozhatnak gondot, néhány szót kell csak érteni. Szívesen játszom vele még, de valószínűleg nem lesz kedvenc. Még annyit, hogy több  játékossal nagyon korlátos lehet több dolog is, pl. építőmester... Kipróbálnám, milyen mondjuk 4-en. --- Szerencsére újra előkerült. Most hogy többet is játszottunk egymás után, egy nagyon jól sikerült játéknak érzem, javítottam is egyet a ponton. És ami fontos, hogy 70-80 perc alatt simán lemegy egy 3 fős parti. Ma már az átcsábításnak is látom az értelmét, volt olyan parti, ami ezen dőlt el. Minden játékosszámnál más tűnik szűkösnek. 3-an a szabadságjogok, többen az épületek. 4-5 főnél valószínűleg a bónuszok és az átcsábítások jobban kellenek.  Szinte minden partit más taktikával nyerünk meg. És még csak az alap változatnál tartunk... --- Nagyon jók vannak a variánsok közt is, és a kieg is dob még a játékon. Elismerem, hogy a játékvégi pontkártyák közt nagy a szórás, van amelyiket szinte mindig mindenki teljesíti, másikat meg szinte soha... De ennyi nekem belefér, mivel 5-ből kell választani. --- A kieggel egyértelműen többutas a játék. Az alapnál van egy olyan stratégia, amit kicsit túl egyszerűnek és faéknak érzek: az első fázisokban csak mutatványost, esetleg átcsábító kártyát gyűjteni. Ligeteket és építészt hagyni a fenébe. A második fázisokban egy vagy max 2 szabadságjogot, esetleg 1-2 épületet, ha több művésznek is segítenek, de inkább csak körönként 1 újabb személyiség szerzése és alkotás készítése. 5 főnél nyilván szűkös lesz a személyiségek száma, akkor több átcsábító kell. De a lényeg, hogy alkotást kell letenni sokat, mert az sokkal többet hoz mint bármi más... És a mutatványos meg a személykártya mindenképp növeli az alkotás értékét, így egy idő után nem is kell nézni milyen személyt szerzünk, 17 fölé megy az érték (5 mutatványos + 7 személy = 17, és ebben nincs benne az esetleges szabadságjog vagy épület), vagyis a vége felé tetszőleges személy leépíthető így, és darabja hoz 8+ pontot. 3 főnél működik, nyilván több játékosnál nehezebb, de ha vész esetén jobb híján épületet is lehet építeni, vagy bónuszkártyát venni. Ezzel a faékkel ráadásul a körök nagy részében mienk a bónusz 3 pont is. Kiegben és a variánsokban simán vannak olyan stratégiák, amivel ez verhető, és lehet hogy az alapban is, én főleg csak a 3 fősről tudok nyilatkozni.  Ja a kiegnél a pont nem váltható vissza pénzre, ezért ott beállhat a játék. Néhányszor hajszálon múlt, hogy nem szívtuk meg. --- Mostmár annyira egyértelműnek érezzük a mutatványos faék taktikát, hogy kicsit el is bizonytalanodtam a játékkal kapcsolatban. Jó játék alapvetően, de nem jövünk rá a faék ellenszerére. Valószínűleg 5 főnél nincs ilyen gond, de 3 főnél mindenkinek menni kell a mutatványosra, ne legyen valakinek egyoldalan sok... Nálunk mindig az nyert, akinek a legtöbb mutatványosa volt. Akár 1000+ pénzt is megadtunk egy mutatványosért, simán megtérült. Ez kicsit csalódás, de mentségére szolgál, hogy a kieggel többutas marad a játék. Valószínűleg ha a jövőben előkerül, csak kieggel fogjuk használni, most viszont kicsit félretesszük pihenni. A közös épületes kieget is kipróbáltuk, jó kis színt visz a játékba, de nagy kockázat a másiknak egy épületet ajándékozni, nagyon meg kell kérni az árát. Hibának érezzük, hogy a tábláknak ez az oldala nem tartalmazza az épületek listáját, ami nagyon hasznos az alap oldalon.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;This is my 2nd favourite version of all the variations of catan that I have. Its only let down in my opinion is that it is a set board. The resources have a set position and the value of the dice needed for those resources is also set. This reduces variation in the game. Other than that I love the game. Some people do find it a little complex, but the same could be said about Settlers and many of its variations.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;An abstract game with simple rules. The decision are in most cases very clear, therefore it does not really inspire me. (Rating based on two two-player games, probably the game is better with more players and I will update my rating,)&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Provisional rating after one play.   I think there is more depth to this game apart from the deduction element. The outbid mechanic; the ability to forbid access to a certain location (and the consequent bluffing, if you use it in the proper manner); the special abilities of the characters; the &#34;resource management&#34; aspect of the game; all point out to a very thoughtful design.   I think that the game can show its true potential, if you don\&#39;t play linearly and just travel from location to location, but instead try to &#34;play&#34; the game and outsmart your opponents.  I am very eager to play the rest of the cases. My rating will probably go up.   &#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Great game, not so great rule book.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;The best of this type of game that I have played.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Fairly boring, but its not terrible.&#39;, 4.),
 (&#39;Awesome deep strategical area control game. There is some draw luck, and one of the sides (USSR) a bit too powerful in the non-Deluxe version. Also there are few cards that can massively screw up your game due to poor luck (Quagmire, Bear Trap), but its rare.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;too long for a large group, better with four players or less&#39;, 6.),

 (&#39;Goes on far too long.&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;Won in BGG competition in late 2010. Looks like a cute, simple card game. My kids love playing with the components. Will get this to the table in the next month or so.   ***UPDATE***  Not a bad simple cardgame. Nothing too exciting to be found here though.   Given away on Aussie Chain of Generosity May 2011.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Brilliant, simple, party game.  Fun and light.  &#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;Used to be pretty big into Magic back in the 90&#39;s - early 2000&#39;s.  don&#39;t play it at all these days but still have thousands of cards in the closet.  &#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;Simple and fast. A very good intro or filler.  It\&#39;s been compared to Splendor, however aside from the fact that there are public contracts (cards) that all players are vying for, the mechanics are not very similar.  First, the resource pool in Century is not limited. That means that your &#34;plan&#34; on what to do on your next turn can\&#39;t be altered significantly by what other players do. This keeps the game moving at a brisk pace, sometimes comically fast.  Second, Century has a deck-building and engine building aspect. The spices that you gather, and your ability to upgrade spices, is directly impacted by the cards that you add to you caravan (hand). You thus have control of your own destiny in terms of how you build you spice gathering and trading empire. You have the ability to formulate a strategy and customize your caravan towards the cards that you want, and players may grow differently meaning that they\&#39;re not necessarily in direct competition.  That makes the game not so much about who can get certain things first, but who can do things the best. That, to me, makes the game less confrontational and more enjoyable.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Solid little abstract that has more to than first expected.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;A tug-of-war game about the most (famous?) American election. The game is pretty hard to rate because players can&#39;t tell how well they are doing throughout the game. Its almost like watching a story unfold which you have no control over. You play the cards and let the events take shape.  I am not convinced that there is much skillful play involved (aside from the timing of cards), but it is enjoyable to watch the election play out. The debates felt very out of place, almost like blind bidding for an auction. That aside, the game is definitely an improvement over Twilight Struggle.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#34;I just bought a booster pack because I love the ships. From reading the rules, I&#39;m not even interested in playing the actual game. 10 points for components, 3 points for the game =&gt; averaged out to 6.5&#34;, 6.),

 (&#39;A fun social take that game. I find the base set a bit limiting due to only having four characters, but that is what expansions are for. Going to grab the 5th expansion first to get the big box.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;One of the most famous cosmos backgound games. Twilight Imperium has successfully expressed the great space war among various species in the universe. The game, however, also has a few weak points. First, the game too many rule details so that the game has a high barrier to new participator of the game. For example, the game contains hundreds types of cards. Players cannot get used to those special cards in couple of games. At least more than 5 times matches, users can gradually understand how to use appropriate cards and make a proper strategic decision. Second, the game is not really influenced by players&#39; tactical choices, but the better upgrade situation. A diplomatic approaches, strategies, and dice luck is not really working in this game. The aspect of game is mainly affected by the upgrade level. The higher, the better chance to win. If a player has higher upgrade level, the player has more winning conditions. Therefore, it is hard to catch up technological gaps among players. Because of all of these notorious accessibility and hard rule details, I couldn&#39;t give a good grade on the game. Besides these weaknesses, Twilight Imperium is still the one of the best space war games.&#34;, 6.),

 (&#39;is ok, but I did expect something else... What is true is that you always discover a hidden behaviour of the mates on the table playing with you: the best and the worst. Can be played. But now I would not buy it.&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;This is by far the best squad level combat simulations out there (I play Ambush/ASL/MeM 44/and Panzer Gren as well).  Even at it age it still holds up very well.  If you can find a copy of this snap it up you will not be disappointed.  The rule book has a steap learning curve but there are some great rule summaries on this page which will greatly assist you getting right into a game.&#39;, 10.),
 (&#34;Initial Impressions: ---------------------- One of my favorite mechanisms is using cards for multiple purposes, and this is Feld&#39;s take on that!  Wow, this one was really fun.  For a game that is not very complex, this one seems to offer a good amount of tough choices.  The game is also beautiful, with every card having unique art?  Are you kidding me?  Seems like it would play best with 3 or 4, but it was fun with even 2.  I need to explore more, but there seems like a ton of paths to go, but will need time to determine that.  This one looks like a keeper, and I am very much looking to trying it at other player counts.&#34;, 8.),

 (&#39;The game is very low maintenance and quick paced. The area control is streamlined but can get more devious and cutthroat than you expect. The components are quite neat and fit the game and price perfectly.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Good game to begin and/or end an evening of gaming. We gravitate towards heavier games but the group found this to be a blast (and so did I). This is a good game to introduce those new to gaming, and to satisfy those who want social interaction - is a social game above all else.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;The ultimate in bash-athons.  Excruciating choices and lots of dice! Need to have other activities for those who are eliminated.  The fact others don&#39;t want to play as often, but still do probably keeps it a high hitter for me.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#34;In GAMES Magazine&#39;s 2007 Games 100&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;Smash up is not a deck-building game, per say.  At the beginning of the round, you combine two different decks and then fight it out with other players.  The game effectively revolves around area control, as you attempt to gain a superior force at the different bases on the table.  As each base succumbs to various forces, a new base is revealed.  I definitely enjoy the game, but it feels a little thin out of the box.  More factions would be great, although for the low cost this is a great multiplayer game that plays quickly.  One of the stronger elements of the game is the artwork and theme of the different decks; they are very diverse.  The production value on this game is very strong, and the manual is very well put together as well.  AEG did a great job with all of the bits.  One last gripe; they need victory point counters!  You need a pen and paper to play, although this obviously isn\&#39;t the end of the world.  Dice are helpful, as they can help track the strength at a base which is an important mechanic.  **I do not recommend this game for 2 players.   I am in the minority here on the poll, apparently, but there are way better 2 player card games out there.  The &#34;gotcha&#34; nature of Smash Up is really geared towards multiplayer.&#39;, 7.),

 (&#39;A reasonable game. Not a great deal of meat to it, low on player interaction and a good deal of luck. Simple rules, good quality components. Too long for this filler depth game&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;Played this once, and the end is just the end. After the game it was just over and I felt \&#39;ok it\&#39;s over?\&#39;. I was thinking about the game afterwards and I think it has a couple problems:   * there isn\&#39;t a lot of character development - even though you have a bunch of events, your character doesn\&#39;t change much from the beginning to the end of the game. with &#34;success&#34; numbers for the encounters ranging from ~5-10, that\&#39;s not a big range (especially considering your range likely starts from ~1-7).  * there aren\&#39;t any options when you level up - it would be nice to choose which spells to upgrade or what new spells to gain to add to your ability deck. (I played the priest and was sad to learn after we started that the only option was a PVP shadow spec. If you know me; you know that\&#39;s absolutely 180 degrees from my personality)  * there aren\&#39;t that many items that you are actually interested in keeping. in the course of the game; i only put on 4 items.  being a game called world of warcraft; i expected to be trying to make my character stronger and getting cool new stuff over the course of the game. alas, that\&#39;s not really how it plays out.&#39;, 3.),
 (&#34;The game is loaded with intricate mechanisms, perhaps slightly to its own detriment, but individually they&#39;re not all that complex, only when you bring them all together it can be a chore to learn and remember. That said, I find it dripping with the theme, where others feel it&#39;s dry, and it&#39;s really a brilliant translation of Portuguese wine making and buying on a purely aesthetic and economic level, but not one I&#39;d recommend for newer players to the Euro style. There&#39;s a lighter option called Viticulture for that, but if you do love the brain burn, and many do, Vinhos is your game.&#34;, 8.),

 (&#39;Another of the average to mediocre Knizia small-box games, this one works better than most and does OK on the theme front. Didn&amp;#039;t blow me away - I liked Clash of the Lightsabres better - but definately OK, which is getting to be better than expected for small-box stuff from Knizia.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Based on one play: Basically just a random throwing of cards onto other players characters. You are trying to kill off the other characters, but everyone plays at the same time. So you just place and hope for the best. Not really fun, strategic or original. There are much better speed based games.&#39;, 3.),

 (&#34;I don&#39;t like the main mechanic of lying/bluffing and having to guess if the other person is lying/bluffing.&#34;, 2.),
 (&#34;For some reason, I couldn&#39;t stop giggling as aspects of the game were explained to me. Images of Pacino blasting with his M16 in Scarface kept coming to mind.  The gameplay is decent. Players expand and build up a mafia empire, gaining income to build more troops. They win by taking over Manhattan or eliminating all other players or getting $6K of income in one turn.  The theme is great. Combat is ok.  Poor placement of the gang boss and family members and can lead to an early wipeout of players. Watch out for limos, choppers and boats that could easily attack your strongholds. Place corrupt precincts in good locations to block off other bosses.  Personally, I like going for a Manhattan blitz.  Loooonnnnnggg downtime between players is a big detraction to the gameplay.&#34;, 6.),

 (&#34;I love the Victory in the West series of games.  The play quickly, are simple to learn, and present challenging tactical/operational problems for both sides.  Patton&#39;s Third Army may look like an American pushover, but with the weather and some good German reinforcements, it can be very tough for the US.  &#34;, 9.),
 (&#39;A sort of Western version of Caylus. Not as much &#34;gunslinging&#34; as I thought there would be. Maybe it was just the group I was playing with. Still, it seems to be missing something in the theme.&#39;, 8.),

After several plays it probably lacks variety, but there is an expansion.&#34;, 8.),

 (&#34;2018-08-31 - 4 - Just a card game with numbers and colours. I&#39;m not a fan of such a games usually and this one didn&#39;t impress me.&#34;, 4.),
 (&#39;Owned it for a short while. Miniatures would have made it much better.&#39;, 4.),
 (&#39;Rather confusing game... I wonder if there actually could be found a game between the lines of the too long rules. &#39;, 4.),
 (&#34;I like how there are ways to mitigate the randomness of the dice. Dedicated decks for each Ancient One mean each play is themed according to your chosen foe.  I especially love how it&#39;s less fiddly than Arkham Horror 2nd ed!&#34;, 10.),
 (&#39;Yet another game based on the original &#34;Pachisi&#34;... which was created in India around 500 B.C.   Other games like &#34;Sorry&#34; and &#34;Pop-O-Matic Trouble&#34; were also based on Pachisi.  Fun, simple marble game that I enjoyed playing as a kid.  I can\&#39;t imagine getting too many adults excited to play it today, though.  If you have some kids around... it\&#39;s a good time passer.&#39;, 4.),

 (&#34;Tried to play, didn&#39;t get all the way through.  Has some cool concepts and I can see how this would be a stellar game.  Looking forward to trying again once I have a slightly better grip on the rules.  &#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;you need some luck, but still good and simple working game!&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;I&#39;ve only played once, as the 4th player in a 4p game...and got shut out from the first turn. There was literally no possible way for me to get back in the mix...through no fault of my own. I found that frustrating.   The concept of the game works, although with more players it could tend to overstay its welcome. I&#39;d like to play again.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#34;Now this is a city builder! Each round in this game players build 1-3 building tiles, or they build 1, and expand the area they are allowed to cover on their boards. The building tiles are tetris pieces, and their placement rules and abilities change slightly depending on their size. Similar to in Town Center, to have a larger building it needs a certain number of adjacent tiles of the correct colors. This can be extremely challenging, because while this is all happening you need to worry about creating enough jobs to attract new meeples to your board, and you need to worry about managing your pollution levels, because each turn you accrue pollution which converts directly to negative points at the end of the game, and worse yet, other players can send one of their meeples to your city, to get in your way and take those crucial action spaces on your buildings that you so carefully constructed.  The game is complicated, tense and really fantastic. I can&#39;t wait for more plays of this game.  :star: Art, Iconography and components functional :star: Clever or interesting mechanisms :nostar: Reasonably low downtime between turns with mildly AP players :star: Multiple plays stay interesting :star: Low or mitigatable luck elements :star::star::star::star::nostar: Raw enjoyment&#34;, 8.),

 (&#39;Enjoyed this game a lot. Great production values, great gameplay, love the dice-rolling/press-your-luck mechanism, and awesome theme. Great in coop, but have only played with two people so far. Wondering how adding more people (and more difficulty) may change my rating....&#39;, 10.),
 (&#34;Just received, but no play yet. The components overall are stunning, both in appearance and physical quality. I think the board in the original game was cheesier, but better looking -- this one is rather dark. Regardless of how the game plays, this one might be irresistible for the Lovecraft fans (like me!). Anyway, for less than $35 from Boulder Games, I don&#39;t see how you can go wrong.  Edit: I&#39;ve played numerous times now. It&#39;s fun for people who like the topic, and don&#39;t mind the fiddly play. It&#39;s pretty process heavy for a lighter game. It&#39;s not something I&#39;d like to play all the time, but I can be talked into it. (as long as I don&#39;t have to set it up) I played the original quite a bit years ago, but there are so many better games out now, even better Lovecraft themed games.&#34;, 5.),
 (&#34;Simple to play, and simple to teach.  I&#39;ve played this a number of times with people aged 10-70 and everyone has enjoyed every minute of it.&#34;, 9.),
 (&#39;I have played with the prototype. I first saw this game at Spiel 3 years ago. The art was phenomenal and the details were just amazing. I have seen many people from many different places and across a wide age range, both men and women, play and love this game. The dice rolling for combat and the ability to re-roll or force your opponent to re-roll is super fun.   I would like to disclose that I work at White Wizard Games, and these are my personal impressions of this game.&#39;, 10.),
 (&#39;I like the changes from second edition. &#39;, 9.),
 (&#34;Maybe it&#39;s just my group, but this drags... and drags.... and drags.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;Good kids game. English verssion is called &#34;M is for Mouse&#34;. Kids try and match beginning letters with corresponding pictures. My kids really enjoy this one and it has a bit of eduacational value too!&#39;, 5.),
 (&#34;A clever, thematic game with fabulous production quality.  I admire the design and the way the game operates, but for me there was too much to take in, so I really didn&#39;t know what strategy I should try to follow.  For our first (4 player) game it took close on 5 hours to complete, by the time we&#39;d waded through 90 mins of setup and rules.  The expected mid-game scoring for a ticket pile depletion didn&#39;t happen because the bag unexpectedly emptied of meeples.  For virtually every move we had to refer to a very useful member-created player aid which detailed step-by-step all the things you had to do for each worker you placed. If we skipped looking at the aid we tending to forget one of the 7 or 8 things you had to remember to do, in the right order.  Without that aid we&#39;d have been all over the place, so a big thank you to user schnel and his aid found here: https://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/126498/one-page-player-aid-gallerist-version-10  Although the kicked-out worker feature seems pretty neat, it does disrupt the flow of play and can result in a fair bit of downtime before your turn comes round.  And with only four worker placement spots the kicked-out action happens quite a lot (in a 4 player game, maybe it wouldn&#39;t with fewer players).  A great game but too many fiddly rules with a plethora of possible end game bonuses to try to choose from means I&#39;m not hurrying to play it again.&#34;, 8.),

 (&#39;nothing special, solitare with no interaction between players(besides the draft phase)&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;Finally another dexterity game worth playing. Fun to play and the action cards give the game another dimension. Would probably be awesome as a party game, but haven&#39;t tried it.  Must buy.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#34;If I have 3 players who are wiling to try something a bit heavier than entry level, then this is THE game.   I&#39;d love for it to get picked up and further developed by a company like Hans im Glück or FFG to refine some bits, and hone some balance.  Expansions would be hard to create but SO WELCOMED!&#34;, 9.),
 (&#39;A fun, if rather abstract, civilization-building and conquering game.  A mechanically optimized Euro--it is much blander than History of the World, which I do not find to be a good comparison.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Probably one of the finest designs of recent years.  Startlingly innovative mechanics married to simple, accessible gameplay.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Excellent easy escape room.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Meh. Pen and paper and nothing to do? I guess this could be okay. It would be really silly to buy a version of this though. &#39;, 3.),
 (&#39;Great player-driven combat game that can be very chaotic, but from human choices, not random events or die rolls. Lots of ways to create your sub and experiment with tactical combinations. Activation mechanic is fresh and interesting. Not sold on the &#34;collectible&#34; mentality, but something a little different worth checking out.&#39;, 7.),

 (&#39;2P&#39;, 9.),
 (&#34;This is a tough game to evaluate.  On one hand it is a solid brain twister of strategy.  On the other it feels like it has too much luck.  The initial &#39;secret mission&#39; cards are troubling.  Any one individual card is rarely a problem, but as a collective group for all playes, the luck of the draw (relative to others) is critical.  The basic turn mechanics are solid and work very well.  The game play is enjoyable, but after many losses, I still have no clue how to beat  the initial card draw problem.  Frustrating...  [GTI Code: TGxD]&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;Played once, and after an hour, suicide never sounded so good&#39;, 2.),
 (&#39;Fun for a couple of games, but I quickly lost interest in it. Rather play real chess.&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;Crystal Clans does certainly feel like a Colby Dauch game, inspired by his classic Summoner Wars but nowhere near imitating it. At its basic point CC has asymmetric factions that are intriguing and change your style of game based on which faction you control. The game also seems inspired by a sort of &#34;Team Fortress&#34; theme where you have to run out into the common field and hold two regions for points, but making yourself open to attack. The initiative track is brilliant and might be worth the price of admission itself. The artwork looks very much like something you might find in an iPad game, so you might like that style or not. Melding armies together and selecting your special army power gives you something to think about as well. And controlling your draw pile size to prevent your opponent from getting a free crystal (1 of 4 points to win) adds another layer to the game. With all these great things being said, I still found the experience a little muddy and felt somewhat chaotic at times - not really a feeling I like. Something like SW gives more opportunity for plotting and building a plan and CC is mean and unforgiving right from the get-go - which I agree is a flavour of the game and not a fault. While combat is a big part of the game it is not an overwhelming part - but I\&#39;m not sure I care that much for the combat. Maybe it\&#39;s better than dice, but it felt a little sloggy adding up different attack and defense values, considering special powers, and then finally adding in the &#34;battle values&#34; in the end - which works like a rock/scissors/papers thing, but feels way more random than maybe it\&#39;s supposed to. It adds a bit of &#34;fog of war&#34; to a game which might not be any better than chucking dice (though it might be more interesting). I would imagine repeated plays would improve the flow and familiarity with the factions would reveal more strategic options. So in the end: Crystal Clans is a very good game that didn\&#39;t win my affections immediately but has the possibility of courting my favour has time goes on.&#39;, 7.),

 (&#39;Wiele opinii na temat tej gry jest zadziwiająco mylnych: artefakty zbyt potężne, efekt neutralny warzenia zostawiający nas daleko w tyle, niewiele możliwości ruchu, długi czas rozkładania elementów gry. Bynajmniej. Grę pokazałem swojej drugiej połówce na początku naszej przygody z grami planszowymi i nie sprawiło jej żadnych problemów ogarnięcie zasad. Obecnie rozgrywki kończą się minimalną przewagą punktową jednej lub drugiej strony. W grze jest wiele zasad, jednak dobrze przygotowany Mistrz Gry z łatwością wprowadzi nowe osoby do świata Alchemików.  Grę można wygrać bez korzystania z artefaktów - sprawdziłem tę możliwość w rozgrywce 3-osobowej. Gdy dopisze nam szczęście, już w drugiej rundzie możemy odkryć alchemon danego składnika. Następnie podczas kolejnych rund można skupić się na krzyżowaniu planów innych graczy, odkrywaniu kolejnych alchemonów, celowemu publikowaniu fałszywych teorii bądź przygotowaniu na konkurs warzenia mikstur. Cudownym momentem gry jest odkrycie alchemonu składnika i powrót do wyników naszych poprzednich testów, co owocuje odkryciem kolejnych alchemonów. Gdy po pierwszym warzeniu otrzymamy miksturę neutralną, już w trzecim warzeniu możemy znać aż 2 alchemony. Metod na rozwiązanie tajemnicy alchemonów jest wiele i od nas zależy, w jaki sposób najszybciej i najefektywniej do takiego rozwiązania dotrzemy.  Instrukcja podpowiada, że podczas gry osób zaznajomionych z mechaniką gry wraz z osobami nowymi, ci pierwsi mogą korzystać z mniejszej ilości składników dostępnych na początku rozgrywki i mistrzowskiego podważania teorii. Dzięki temu rozgrywka jest interesująca i wymagająca zarówno dla doświadczonych graczy, jak i tych świeżych.  Czas rozłożenia gry jest krótki (niecałe 5 minut), jeśli wszystko mamy poukładane i posortowane w workach strunowych. Osobiście współczuję osobom, które poświęcają aż 30 minut na przygotowanie elementów gry... Oprawa wizualna Alchemików jest przejrzysta, przepiękna, barwna, komiczna i solidna. Elementy tekturowe są bardzo twarde i grube, zaś kostki i ampułki błyszczące. Podczas rozgrywki można korzystać z aplikacji na systemach IOS, Andorid i Windows bądź wersji przeglądarkowej. Jeśli w pomieszczeniu jest zbyt ciemno, aby skanować składniki, można je dodać ręcznie z dostępnej puli. W grze podstawowej korzystanie z oprogramowania jest opcjonalne. Do gry wydany został oficjalny dodatek, który moim zdaniem jest wręcz obowiązkowy i warty swej ceny.&#39;, 10.),

 (&#39;This LCG had some interesting design choices.  The Capitol board mechanic is my favorite - using your unit placement to adjust your income, cards, and attack power. The diverse faction design was also neat. Having draft built into the core set was clever, but perhaps poorly executed.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;An interesting speed game. I like it but am not sure how often it will hit the table. Great filler game!&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;In love with this after one 4-player game. We&#39;ll see if it holds up. My only complaint is that the board is ugly as sin, muddled and not so functional.  The 2-player game is pretty good too.  Brilliant game. Playing the players is the key here, as well as knowing when to spend your high numbered buildings and when to hold back. I tend to keep them around until late in the game then spend them in a flurry. Of course, if you don&#39;t meet the requirements on your goal cards, it doesn&#39;t much matter. In fact, the goal cards are the only thing I don&#39;t like about Metropolys; some are much easier than others. There are lots of decisions here, deciding how much to value a given spot on the board and whether you can afford to let your opponent claim a given spot.  I have the Metropolys cards from the Ystari box.&#34;, 8.),

 (&#34;I don&#39;t know what it is about this game but I obsessed over it half a year before I ever even played it.   There&#39;s something about this game that really connects with me. The combination of theme, tone, game play and aesthetics make for a very rewarding experience.   I love the beautiful illustrations, the huge variety of play combinations, and how so much of the responsibility for the game&#39;s balance is placed in the hands of the players.  &#34;, 10.),
 (&#34;The good:  Theme is incorporated well, components are nice, Life cards are cool, characters have unique abilities, *some* luck mitigation with Quickening tokens, character development enhances the game  The bad: Very reliant on luck, timing issues for effects, rerolls cause a lot of chaos, doesn&#39;t scale well from lower to higher player counts, rulebook incomplete, Dueling happens between everyone present, rather than one-on-one  The ugly: A player may be beheaded/eliminated in the first round and have no way to avoid it.  A player could draw up to 12 Encounter or Era cards in their turn, need to read each one, while the other players wait.  In higher player count games multiple ties will bring you to the Arena over and over again  Summary:  I think a rating of 6/10 is fair for this game.  I love the theme, and some of the aspects of this game are nice.  But there are several failings in the design of this one.  I came up with a set of house rules which addresses the failings, and makes this much more enjoyable.&#34;, 6.),

 (&#34;FFG edition. Played once. Theme was right up my alley and I enjoyed it enough to acquire a cheap copy for myself. I need to play again to get a clearer opinion. I&#39;m not sure that all my friends enjoyed it, so I&#39;m not sure if and when a replay will happen.  Edit: Replayed a couple of times solo, which works because there&#39;s no hidden information. A fun historical narrative for me but I could see why players might not like it. There&#39;s no strong identification with nations, the massing of victory points lacks a feel of an historical goal and it&#39;s full of easily overlooked exceptions, which also makes it difficult for any but very experienced players to play well. Probably not one I&#39;m likely to get to the table with others very often but still happy to play it myself.&#34;, 7.),

 (&#39;An incredibly absorbing game that, if you are so disposed, can provide you with an enormously rewarding journey. It can take years to become even competent at ASL, depending on your frequency of play and how willing you are to absorb the rules, but is surprisingly simple in many ways and so it is quite possible to play quickly. Addictive beyond compare, fascinating, exciting, colorful, and heartbreaking all at the same time, with unlimited replay value; in short, everything a great wargame should be.&#39;, 10.),
 (&#39;Cut my teeth on this game in 89, major flaws to this system, but it was WAY wide open. Had some fun with it back in the day.&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;I always enjoy playing this game.  I recently found the game at a used bookstore (Winning Moves Deluxe edition).  After one session, the cards were in pretty bad shape.  Although they may be good for another session, I was disappointed how quickly they suffered, especially considering the necessity of wear as determined by game rules.  If you plan on playing this a lot, invest in card sleeves.  &#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;I respect the design of Puerto Rico. The role selection mechanism creates an interesting dynamic and injects some tactical considerations into an otherwise static strategy game. Without the role selection, it&#39;d be too close to Saint Petersburg and its ilk for my liking. Puerto Rico is a lot more interesting, as it&#39;s way better at weaving together the effects of player actions. But at heart it&#39;s an engine-building game, and I&#39;d rather play San Juan, Race for the Galaxy, or Glory to Rome in this genre, and I only ever find myself requesting Glory to Rome. If I hadn&#39;t played any of those games, I suspect I&#39;d like Puerto Rico a lot more than I do. It&#39;s a lot drier by comparison. And count me among those who don&#39;t like the theme of the game, as abstract as it is.&#34;, 5.),
 (&#34;It&#39;s good fun, but becomes familiar quite quickly. And if the boulder is slow, the all-important tension won&#39;t build properly. The special ability Stamina is way overpowered.

 (&#39;I like quiz games and the idea that you could bet on others knowledge is a fun twist. But there are some flaws I think, for example I think you should not be allowed to bet on the final question. Everybody just bet all they can on a wrong answer since if they are wrong the game is over anyway. Or at least the maximum bet should be reduced on the final question.&#39;, 5.),

 (&#39;Light rummyish game with a hint of strategy.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;It&#39;s a refreshing idea that every item in the game serves as an individual currency for a certain action. Money for movement and buying goods, goods for placing markets and markets for selling goods.I know no other game that in such a creative way combines all the elements of the game.   Drawback of the game are the arrows on the map. After a few plays it feels like going round in circles.  The game has a low replayability rate. And when urged to go trough the rules every once in a while ... Other games make it more often to the table. &#34;, 6.),

 (&#34;Stefan Feld revisits the head-to-head Roman combats, with wolves, bears, lions and triremes in the Colosseum... well, maybe it&#39;s not quite THAT thematic, but Arena: Roma II presents both a nice stand-alone game, with some nice enhancements to the orginal (e.g., the Bribery slot,) as well as what seems a more balanced set of cards for the duelers.  Like Roma this is a one-on-one, may the best player win game.  The same set of 3 dice are used to activate cards, and similar empty slot penalties are in play.   Instead of the 1-6 pip discs, Arena: Roma II provides a nice belt built of interlocking sections, and it adds a new slot to the six basic ones, which raises the number needing to be filled, but also the number of available cards. The new slot- the Bribery slot- is available with any die, but requires sesterces matching the pips to activate the card there. This means with funds it can be used very frequently, and this can create some interesting strategies all on it&#39;s own.  After a first solo play I give this a 7.5; making it among Feld&#39;s best games, and enhancing an older one with a couple of flaws.  Nothing like improving on a good idea! &#34;, 8.),

 (&#39;Fun party game with non-gamer friends.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;The basic version with two players is extremely brutal due to the few available spots on the board and the huge difference the two extra energy makes when coming in first vs. second. But the full version with the extra spots on the dark alley and the additional ways to gain extra energy help quite a bit, and the playtime is actually not too bad with two players (probably 1.5 to 2 hours).&#39;, 7.),

 (&#34;Simple and rich. I don&#39;t get tired of this game.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;One play so far.  The game is easy to set-up and to play.  We had a few rules questions, but not too many.  We played a three player game, which seemed to work out well.  The bidding/out-bidding rules seemed overly limiting but I think we appreciated them more as the game went on.  Good player interaction through the bidding system.  This is mostly a player versus game though where disasters and supply play a huge role in the outcome.  Nice to have another limited duration but not just a pure filler type of game in the closet.&#39;, 7.),

 (&#39;Very simple yet thinky movement/scoring game.  I think the pawn color choices are suspect, but otherwise a fine game.  Only other complaint is that planning ahead is almost discouraged, making for some long turns.  Base game is a 6, the advanced version is a 7.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Excellent asymmetric, highly thematic game. Offers a lot of replayability with all the variants and role combinations. Highly recommend it! &#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;A really great, streamlined implementation of a dungeon-crawler. Plays fairly quickly, the dice pool building is done really well, and it&#39;s a really wonderful solo game. This was exactly what my collection needed for quick, rewarding solo gaming.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;Excellent family game, but playing seriously means you soon suss the strategies.&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;I enjoyed this one after initially having a bad first impression after a deadly first round.  One comment - make sure to draft armor in the first round!  It is a bit fiddly but plays relatively simply.  The opportunity to pass monsters creates an interesting dynamic.  Diversity in weapon skills will likely prove helpful.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Space 4x with a variety of races to give each game a different flavor.  Works best with a larger group.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Fun short game. Played it before I got into Star Wars Minis. Rebels seemed to win more often than Imperials. Always seemed like the AT-ATs were destroyed too easily. Good game for the Star Wars fan.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Random and quirky but fun!&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Simple and super fun DC. Played it with 2.0 Arcade rules. Need to try the classic rules. having hearts pop out of monsters is super cool and the power creep feel is nice too. Difficulty varies A LOT depending on the monsters and heroes you play.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Shows how far we have come -- I used to love this game.  Does get repetitive, but it is enough different from a lot of other games to be worth a look.  Anyway, the round counter are cool  I agree with the article that says dice extremes are a killer here.  The game was best playing the complex options, with rail heads, oild, etc.  Its silly, though, that bombing a city once with one bomb counter is the key condition.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;The rulebook doesn&#39;t do all that great of a job of explaining some of the game concepts.  The conflict resolution is neat, using elements of Poker.  Some of the factions (Sweetrock, for example) were a little unbalanced at first, and have since been revised.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#34;[b][i]Axis &amp; Allies[/i][/b] was my (and many others&#39;) introduction to war games. Created in 1981, this is still the standard for global-scale World War 2 board games. However, gameplay wise the slow player-by-player turn sequence and simple (but still fun!) dice combat make A&amp;A feel dated relative to more recent games. This game is nominally 5-player--and it&#39;s great if you can get a willing enthusiastic group. However, the long wait times between turns make this most easily played with 2 people.  Perhaps it&#39;s because I&#39;ve had so many good times with this game, but I hope that everyone tries this game at least once. Unfortunately for my nostalgia, I think games such as Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, War of the Ring, A Game of Thrones: The Board Game, or Warrior Knights are better games. But I [i]would[/i] recommend A&amp;A for people interested in learning the basic flow and geography of World War 2.  The modified map, inclusion of destroyers, and various other tweaks lead me to prefer the 2004 edition over previous editions.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;Absolutely wonderful gem of a game!!  Highly addicting gameplay.  Lots of choices to make in a short timespan.  Luck factor is very high, so others may want to be aware of that.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;gateway game &#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;Pretty fun family game surprisingly&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Another decent dice game, good to pass the time and see how gutsy you are.  Again 98% luck.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;5&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Kickstarter&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;Point salad done right.  Enjoyable throughout.  Easy to teach, easy to play, hard to master.  Many different paths to success in this game.  Very intriguing. &#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;Played once&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Rating after one four-player game.  I found the lack of control annoying, as well as the zig-zag scoring track, but the rest of the artwork is stunningly beautiful.  I think the game might work really well as a two-player and I look forward to trying it that way. &#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;一到四都行&#39;, 10.),
 (&#34;I&#39;m just not sure coop games are for us. They have no legs over time. This isn&#39;t bad but just doesn&#39;t get played.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;I really like Tiket to Ride. Simple but not oversimplified rules, great intro game, beautiful components.  May take a little to long for what it is, but almost irreplaceable if you want to introduce someone to boardgames.  &#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;A fun, family friendly co-op game.  Easy enough for the little ones, but engaging enough for the adults.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Dungeon crawler. &#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Great with 2! Play with governors, records, advanced variant, and variants posted by designer on bgg. The basic game is just boring. &#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Played this at a game convention where the creators were demoing. Great guys and great game. Backed on Kickstarter! Excited to see it come to life.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#34;It&#39;s not living up to the expectations.  I find it very easy, and I&#39;m not interested in the story due to the way it unfolds/reveals itself.  We haven&#39;t really come close to losing, and it&#39;s been like a year since we played.  Disappointing.&#34;, 5.),
 (&#39;Not only a nostalgia trip, but also a good game. Fantastic production (and the expansions add even more) married to the interesting puzzles involved in getting the right machines to the right places to get the right tokens to set the other players to handle the next Disaster or Scheme. A bit like snooker, really.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;?&#39;, 3.),
 (&#39;OK Donald Vaccarino is officially a genius.  He saw a great mechanism from the CDG world that the rest of the design world totally missed.  You used it to create something innovative and very clever.  I just wish the player interaction was a little deeper, and that they had avoided the generic medieval setting and gone with a more compelling theme.  &#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;A game which is awesome and enjoyable once  you get the hang of it.&#39;, 10.),
 (&#39;Random pub brawling in the world of advanced D&amp;D, odd game rules which are pretty confusing but its an ok filler and feels good in a themey way&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;A cool variant on the pick up and deliver train game.  I love the steam punk/air ship theme and the art and components are top notch.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;fun and very strategic, though hard to find people to play with. Haven&#39;t had chance to play in years.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;Interesting 2 player tile laying game.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;B  2-4 Spieler&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;Classic. but old school style.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;aesthetics: 1/2 mechanics: 2/2 replayability: 1/2 rules grit: 1/2 theme: 1/2&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;This should be called Quarterback Island.  Synergizing the best combination of abilities from multiple spirits always leads to people sitting on their hands while one person masterminds everything.  Best played solo.  Very fiddly - too many minis, cards, tokens, counters, etc.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;As a long-time Axis and Allies fan, some observations on this one: Plus: great components and map, interesting rule twists, tactical airpower modeling seems historical, rather historical order of appearance of units.  Minus: Fortune cards can wildly swing the results - can take over a game, units lose their identity once they come off the reinforcement sheet and on to the board.  A pretty decent game, but not the best game in the AA lineup.   Beyond the plays I&#39;ve logged here at BGG, I estimate I&#39;ve played this ~2 times prior to my logging of plays. &#34;, 7.),
 (&#34;I rate children&#39;s games based on how much I enjoy playing with the children &amp; how much they are engaged in the game.    Great for a 2 year old, but had trouble using the squirrel tongs until 2 1/2.  Losing all the acorns prolongs the game &amp; concentration waned.  I got a little bored with it too.  The 5 year old did just fine with it.&#34;, 5.),
 (&#39;A real game changer. Literally.&#39;, 10.),
 (&#39;Ok game, but way too long for the return. &#39;, 5.),
 (&#34;I&#39;ve played a few games of ToC now, and while they have been fine, there is a slightly empty feeling to the experience.  While in a game like Pericles, you can easily map the concepts to the history, here the central mechanic of building your hand did not feel terribly evocative of anything to me.  Not offensive, but not something I feel like I need to own a copy of.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#34;This is a great game.  I&#39;d say that those who say that it&#39;s just a dexterity game are missing the point.  Yeah, you need to have some skill at placement, but there is also a strong territorial grab element.  The rules are not really as bad as they say, and the stuff on the polarity website fixes any confusion I had.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#34;Love the game in all it&#39;s weirdness, but there are a few factions with some spitefull mechanics that ruin the mood. I&#39;m looking at you saboteur.&#34;, 9.),
 (&#39;With one expansion.&#39;, 10.),
 (&#34;I find this to be a bit more entertaining than Hanabi but it&#39;s not going to knock anyone&#39;s socks off.&#34;, 5.),
 (&#39;very simple but fun game!&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;While it&#39;s sometimes an uneven experience, I have never found another game that I could enjoy past the 3 hour mark. This game&#39;s lack of structure is super unforgiving, but finding your way out from being totally lost is delicious. Perhaps the lows are too low, but i love the highs in this game.  EDIT: With Star Wars Rebellion I now have TWO games that I can play past the 3 hour mark, so this game is in good company.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;Update 11/07/12:  Actually pretty fun with different groups of people. Will reserve judgement, but definitely still good.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Beautiful looking optimisation game that plays a little on rails.&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;Ok game, like reading a choose your own adventure but with luck of the die roll to decide your fate. Plays in five different gaming sessions.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Teddy&#39;, 10.),
 (&#39;Solitaire, absolutely no interaction, these kind of games I would play on a computer, not as a social board game.&#39;, 3.),
 (&#39;Clever game. Beautiful art&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;I&#39;ve played a number of games with 5 players and found Saboteur to be surprisingly engaging. The game seems to be well-balanced for 5 players. Finding out who is/are the saboteur(s) was the most interesting part of the game. But there was also a lot of tension towards the end of some rounds as it was far from clear whether the miners could find the gold. &#34;, 7.),
 (&#34;A good party game.  Well, there isn&#39;t so much &#39;game&#39; here per se, but that&#39;s not what its about.  I like movies, and the system works well.  I&#39;m sure we would run out of questions if we played it all the time, but it only comes out occasionally and hasn&#39;t been a problem.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;Initially got me into purchasing the original Heroscape.  Really brings the Marvel universe to Heroscape.  My only complaint is how slow the expansions are coming and the lack of henchmen or additional terrain pieces.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Looks difficult but actually pretty simple to learn.  Love the variable player powers... in a Eurogame!?  Whaaaaat?  I thought that only existed in AT games.  I love that the game feels so different based on what faction you play with.  You aren\&#39;t able to &#34;figure the game out&#34; so easily and that makes it fascinating and really adds to the replayability.  Every time I finish a game I am hungry for more.  You really do get your money\&#39;s worth because there is so much game in this box.  There really isn\&#39;t anything else like this on the market.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;An easy game to play with everyone. Fast, simple, with direct confrontation, quite thematic, a bit of strategy and a lot of luck. Perfect for me.  &#39;, 10.),
 (&#39;Gen Con 2018&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Rating based on 1 (unfinished play) of a 4 player &#34;team&#34; variant. We took 3 hours to not finish and there was probably at least an hour left of play.  Two newbies playing which certainly slowed the game down. I had a lot of fun and one of the newbies kept saying &#34;I love this game&#34;.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Decent, light game. Some mechanics remind of Patrician.  Weird rule says you have to build on your turn if unless you roll an &#34;F&#34;, but your die roll may not always be sufficient to allow this.  House rules others have done look like re-roll or take a fortune card if this happens.&#39;, 2.),
 (&#34;Ludicrously complex. You have eighteen turns to get everything done, but each turn can basically be expanded into three turns if you can afford it. Modular in nature, and plays well at all player counts, especially 3. Not much art, but what little is there is fantastic, and the layout is extra crisp.  Teaching it is a bit of a pain, especially because so much of it is so different than its genre-mates. Nothing really replenishes, so other than a few things, you&#39;re locked in with what you see. To make things worse, setup between player counts is identical except the side pipe shops, so you&#39;ll see the entire game every time. Every game leaves me with that brain-smoothening feeling. I love it.&#34;, 9.),
 (&#39;My son loves this a lot more... probably an 8 for children.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Neat concept, but pulp history, puerile humour, tired references and sexist artwork put me off. In addition, the activation mechanic is too laboured for what should be a quick game.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;Rex is an interesting game that is a ton of fun when you get to a high level of play. At the lower levels, it can seem very confusing as to what to do.  I like the game a lot because it does many things right. I like how each faction feels very different from the next and has their own powers and weaknesses. I like how the board is functionally great for games of multiple player sizes unlike Game of Thrones. I like how the combat system is both cerebral, yet simple, a very elegant and quick design. I like the alliance system where it is binding unless a new one is decided at certain events in the game.  Here are my gripes. I think the game might have too many strategy card types. Unless you play the game a lot, you probably won&#39;t remember what a Informant does or how many cards there are in the deck. I also find that not having a weapon is a huge disadvantage and is difficult to play against someone who does have one. The game could be a bit shorter as well.  So it&#39;s a good game and I&#39;m happy to play it with like-minded people, but new players should probably play something else.&#34;, 9.),
 (&#39;So good, but impossible to find.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;A card drafting (through a market) and tableau creation game.  It wins major points for being highly interactive and one of the best themed games I&#39;ve ever seen.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;Fun negotiation game! Really just a blast to play, and all the different alien races allow for just a really great and different experience every time. One great thing is scales well for any number of playings(never played with the 7 or 8th player). Always a great game to pull out at a game night.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;An almost purely cooperative game.  Even with competitive scoring, there are never petty payback plays.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;A complete and utter failure.  If you like Risk.... stick with Risk.&#39;, 2.),
 (&#34;4 player. Initially very complex but soon got the hang of it although am often confused between the various colour ingredients as symbols on the advisors is missing and the cubes don&#39;t have matching symbols. Didn&#39;t find it particularly exciting the 1st play but enjoyed it far more on the 2nd outing, perhaps because I enjoy heavier games more in the 3 years since my previous play.  Strategy tip: make the most beer and you&#39;ll probably win! Keep your costs to a minimum to afford an extra 2nd board worker.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;One of the better 18xx games. Rather good for beginners as well.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;I count every round as a game. This is tricky because this sums up really fast to lot of play  PPP = 0,50€&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;I love this game.  This is a game where the playing the game is the reward, not winning. I rarely win this game, but am always pushing to bring it out on the table. &#39;, 10.),
 (&#34;I tried and tried to love Agricola &#39;cause everyone else seems to, but I just can&#39;t make it happen.  I should play it more often, but it is a very unforgiving game in which one or two poor moves early can doom a player to defeat.  It is of course possible to learn to avoid these, but this is only possible through repeated plays.  Learning the strengths and weaknesses of the myriad cards is essential as well, and this also takes practice.  I admire Agricola and it excites me in theory, but in practice, it takes too much effort to get to the point of enjoyment for me.  SOLD, October 2014&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;I think I would like it more if I played it more than three times, the first two being basically learning games.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;My favorite (including all expansions).  This game has such a high learning curve and takes many plays to start getting to the &#34;sweet spot&#34;.  There\&#39;s never been a time where I didn\&#39;t want to play this game.  Look me up as Red River Roy at www.duelofages.com Edit 11/07: Still playing at least 4-5 times per month, many years in.  Just the perfect game for me.&#39;, 10.),
 (&#39;As Christopher Bartlett (cc_TheToph) wrote: &#34;Everything that is wonderful, and everything that is terrible about German games in one box.&#34;  I basically agree with this.  It\&#39;s wonderful to play, but afterwards there\&#39;s nothing to remember fondly about.  &#34;hahaha remember that time when I played a red tile and that gave me the one point I needed for the win.  Good times.&#34;  Another thing that I find surprising, is that on BBG most Euros players seem to hate luck in their games.  In T&amp;E, however, the game is almost completely dependent on luck (tiles drawn out of the bag).  Since you have to give up an action to discard your hand, if you have a bad set of tiles, you are in a severe disadvantage because of the Reiner Scoring (tm) system (winner is the highest of the lowest). &#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;After a few plays, I enjoy it a lot. I hope it stays and the DEW North strategy doesn&#39;t ruin it all...&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;Realmente engancha, especialmente a jugadores novatos. Lo bueno es que tampoco cansa demasiado a los jugones ( a menos que siempre quieran jugar a las judías claro)&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;Much lighter version of...yeah you know what. Pretty easy to introduce to people. As usual FFG provides good quality and wonderful artwork. Exciting to play but can get kinda unbalanced if monsters just keeps on pouring out and you have to rely on one character with good abilities and enough items ro use one or more dice.   I like it. It&#39;s not something I&#39;d like to play every day...or every week. But at the right occasion (a dark, rainy evening) it&#39;s perfect!&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;Not mine, but at my place.&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;Relatively easy to play, but has its share of tough decisions.  And one serious mistake and you are out - this game does not forgive them.  Playing with New Society &amp; Banquet Expansion is _absolutely_ mandatory - the game is way more interesting then.  Not less random though.  EDIT: 2-player mode is clearly lacking.  Pass on it.  EDIT 2: The game has worn out for me.  Sold.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;Super fun game that is like battleship, but co-op and modern. Game requires exactly 8 players to be in ideal game mode as 4 players on each team take on 4 very different roles in finding and sinking the oppositions submarine. Communication is vital. I&#39;d rate this higher, but finding 8 players exactly makes this harder to get to the table.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;360 cartes sense funda - Mayday Euro - Blue: Standard (59 x 92mm)&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Box 19&#39;, 5.),
 (&#34;Very fun game to play. A bit of luck involved but it&#39;s quick and challenging.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#34;With some modification on the rules to get it faster and use all the material inside a 2 hours game it&#39;s really nice ! But if you don&#39;t have time to spend many hours on a campaign, it&#39;s not the best choice. Harder to find player willing to play as it is to long.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;A nice beer &amp; pretzels game! &#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;pure hype. &#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;traditional, card, massMarket&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;One of the best solo games you can play!  The concept and design of this is so smart and the mechanics blend beautifully into the theme of the game!&#39;, 10.),
 (&#39;Will always be happy to play this.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;the only way to play is when you say sorrrrrrrrrrrry!!! in a whiney voice and then do a happy dance around the room. yep, i think my brother enjoyed being chased though the house with me swinging the board at him.......really, he did.&#39;, 4.),
 (&#39;Probably the best city-building game out there, but VERY math-driven.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Rails + DB - 2 &#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;It took some hard work to learn the rules and recognize the symbol of the cards, but it was definitely worth it! I like almost everything in this game: theme, artwork of the cards, game mechanics, simultaneous action selection, different tactics to win the game... Definitely one of my favourite card games! I bought the basic set, waiting for the new expansion...  Updated 2013-11-19: Still one of my favourite fast-playing card game.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39; &#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Great family game!&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;This is a quick, easy to learn, and very fun game. A little more luck based than strategic, but extremely thematic and fun to play. My wife loves this game.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;Played this 3-minute game repeatedly for nearly an hour when I was taught it.  It&#39;s a shame it&#39;s so hard to find now.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;One person picks a title randomly and everyone follows suit is really cool, I love the idea but the game is missing something I just can’t place it&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Only fun with expansion&#39;, 4.),

De plus, il a l’avantage d’être facile à apprendre et à expliquer ce qui en fait une bonne introduction au deck-building. Cependant, s’il est joué fréquemment, on fera rapidement le tour des cartes du jeu de base et l’ajout d’extension(s) sera à envisager.  Fait intéressant, il comporte 2 éléments que j’ai rarement rencontré dans les autres deck-building : 1e : mécanique de tableau-builder : en plus des cartes achetées pour ajouter à son deck, un joueur peut aussi acheter des cartes « Bâtiment » qu’il conservera alors à ses côtés afin de construire son village qui lui procurera des avantages permanents à chacun de ses tours de jeu (production et/ou stockage de ressources, conservation et/ou piochage de carte(s) pour son prochain tour). 2e : l’action « Attaquer » : consiste à attaquer un ou des bâtiments d’un adversaire afin de marquer des points de victoire ou y voler des ressources stockées mais à ce moment, le joueur attaqué peut utiliser ses cartes « Défense » en mains, auquel cas c’est lui qui marquera des points de victoire pour avoir contré l’attaque.  ! À noter que même en cas d’attaque réussie (non-contrée), les bâtiments attaqués ne sont jamais détruits, l’action « Attaque » s’apparentant plutôt à un &#34;raid en territoire adverse&#34;. Personnellement, je n’ai aucun intérêt pour la confrontation directe et habituellement j’évite les jeux qui en contiennent mais ici j’apprécie cette mécanique d\&#39;attaque parce qu’il n’y a aucune &#34;destruction&#34; impliquée.  ►EXTENSION(S) ESSAYÉE(S) : &amp; « GUILD WARS » : en partie. &amp; « IT\&#39;S A KIND OF MAGIC » : en partie; à prendre ou à laisser.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;I have played this game more than any other.  It is relentlessly brought forward, for any excuse, by my family.  I am trying to wean them away to something (anything!) that is better.&#39;, 4.),
 (&#39;10/22/99 Bought.  It wins the prize of &#34;most air in the box&#34; of my 235+ games. Scales well from two to four. I like its high nastiness factor. Protect your flanks!!! As of 11/12/19 I\&#39;ve played 67 games.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Snoooooze&#39;, 4.),
 (&#39;ios. Just the right length of game for solo.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;This is probably the one &#34;engine&#34; game that gamers could use to introduce the concept to folks just getting into the hobby.  It\&#39;s fairly straightforward, and new players can have a reasonably good first experience with the game, so long as the experienced players offer up suggestions and tips during the course of the game.  That I\&#39;ve played it so many times, and still want to play it again, speaks volumes to how well the game holds up.  500+ plays: computer 1 play: 2 players 1 play: 3 players 7 plays: 4 players&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;A very clever game that blends an auction mechanic with spatial building.  The last few turns offer huge potential point gains.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Played a good number of games on the original edition for the video game version, would like to play the expansions.  Played the actual card version once at Rust Market.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;In many ways feels like an improvement on the Mage Knight formula, especially with its focus on away teams and diplomatic actions. Probably my preferred use of the system.  Read my review at Mini Market&#39;s Review Corner: http://www.miniaturemarket.com/reviewcorner/star-trek-frontiers-review/&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;3 P W 3.0  probably the most german game on earth :-) usually a 3P game&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Good game, sort of game you pick up once in a while for something completely different.&#39;, 4.),
 (&#39;Works surprisingly well.  Light filler; enough take that! and revenge and light thinking to make it more than just processional.  But random enough that my 9 yr old can win.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Fun game despite the atrocious board. I really like the action tower that gets built up as time goes on.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;Just play Coloretto instead. I don&#39;t see a huge added value here vs. the clean and simple and essentially identical elements of Coloretto. Will bring this one out with the family though.&#34;, 5.),
 (&#39;HARD, HARD, HARD!&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;harmonic spreading constructing game-like economize massive&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;How can you score it fairly? One deck can offer over a thousand different games, so surely it&#39;s a 10. However, over a thousand modern board games are more fun to play than any traditional card game, including poker, so surely it&#39;s only a 5.&#34;, 5.),
 (&#39;I really seem to get screwed on dice rolls.  I played this again and, when it was three people that focused on the game, I liked it better.&#39;, 7.),

 (&#39;Original !&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;[38 plays] This game was all the rage when it first appeared, and I&#39;ve enjoyed it, but I&#39;ve also cooled on it a bit. There&#39;s just a ton of waiting around while everyone thinks, but without that thinking it wouldn&#39;t be very interesting.

 (&#39;Not as elegant as the Eastern front original and it can be a little maddening keeping track of the differences between the two. Still a great game and lots of fun, plays a lot different to the Eastern Front one, which you would expect and the map shuffle is a stroke of genius.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Love the experience when everyone is on board for light RP!  The game is light enough (mostly) for newcomers, but everyone playing must be okay with reading and understanding rules on their own.  If the betrayer is a non-gamer, it especially falls apart.&#39;, 6.),

 (&#39;Batik Kid: a fun game that my son will actually play.  It takes the stacking mechanic similar in other games and forces the pieces to land flush.  This gives an interesting visual similar to slowly building an aquarium of sea creatures.  Great fun to watch and satisfying to play.

 (&#34;I wanted to like Imperial. I did. I had caught a whiff of the hype on BGG about it and thought that the Rondel sounded neat and some of the other mechanics could be cool. So I asked a friend to bring it to a recent game night, and we gave it a play. There was mass confusion at first as we struggled through the rules--even the people who&#39;d played once or twice were having some trouble refreshing themselves--but the game flow was pretty simple once we got the hang of it. It&#39;s largely a war game with economic aspects in how it plays out (not in its win conditions, but we&#39;ll get there later), and I&#39;m not much of a war game person, so it didn&#39;t grab me much there. The fact that we could steal control of countries from each other and, indeed, make it so someone really didn&#39;t have a turn at all was interesting. I mostly contented myself with running Germany into the ground (did I mention that I&#39;m bad at war games?) and buying stocks from whatever country seemed to be doing well at the moment.  And... I won. I managed to [i]accomplish absolutely nothing of value[/i] the entire game, and still came in first place. And while I find that interesting, I also feel like it&#39;s a very cheap win. Yes, you can argue that I handled the game exactly as I should have, and that the others who were doing better on the war-game front had lost sight of the actual victory conditions, or whatever other argument you want to posit. But in the end, I just don&#39;t feel like it was a satisfying win for me, or probably for anyone else at the table. And I&#39;d probably let that slide if I enjoyed the actual gameplay more, but I didn&#39;t. The Rondel was neat but nothing earth-shattering, and I&#39;m just not big on moving armies around. I don&#39;t have a head for that sort of game and find myself just sort of blandly going through the motions when I play such. I&#39;m sure for the right sort of person, Imperial is AWESOME. But I&#39;m not that person.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#34;Come on. It&#39;s Here&amp;Now with a freaking debit card machine. How cool is that? It does make things a lot quicker, though there were problems at first, but I guess it would have helped for me to read the instructions.&#34;, 10.),

 (&#39;Fluxx is a light game that\&#39;s a little like a controlled fall.  You\&#39;re always looking for a way to meet the current win condition or manipulate the win condition.  And if that\&#39;s not working, you can play cards to change the rules to help you win (and/or keep your neighbors from winning)  Game lengths are a little hard to predict.  I\&#39;ve seen a game end on the 2nd hand and I\&#39;ve seen a game go for an hour.  Usually it\&#39;s about 10 to 20 minutes.  I think a person\&#39;s first game is mostly &#34;I don\&#39;t understand... what\&#39;s going on here?&#34;, but they usually get it by the end of the first game and are up for a second game.  We played this often for some quick fun, but we do play Zombie Fluxx a little more often.  So just get both :)&#39;, 7.),

 (&#39;As a fan of Disney stories and lore, I enjoyed how the themes of the villains tied nicely into the gameplay. It’s fun to see Abu steal the magic lamp or the Lost Boys fight off Smee on Captain Hook’s ship. However the gameplay is too lucky/take-that for my tastes.&#39;, 4.),
 (&#34;In theory this sounds like a pretty fun abstract tile-laying game: placing down houses on a modular board with different goals and actions each game. I assume that you know the rules/concept somewhat.  The problem of this game lies in the arc of the game: - The first turn the choice is huge, because you have choice to put you houses anywhere. - Then the turns after that feels limited because you have to put down houses next to where you have a house. That&#39;s why it&#39;s in the first turn important to put next to as little to different types of fields as possible. The thing is, that castles and towns, where you want to be first are adjacent to a lot of different types of fields (which does make it easier to connect to, but harder to connect from). - The mid-game is more interesting as you have more choice, unless, you&#39;re like me and have drawn many of the same types of fields in the previous turns. In this stage you can finally work towards the goal. - In the end game the board is getting cluttered up, so choices feel limited and it&#39;s more about searching where you can block somebody or try to get a point. But there are not a lot opportunities for this and there will be many turns that feel wasted because you don&#39;t score any points. So the excitement is gone and now you just feel obliged to finish the game.  All in all, fun in theory, but only really fun for a few turns in the (mid-)game.&#34;, 5.),

 (&#34;A clone of DC Comics Deck-Building Game, but as odd as it sounds, I think the theme works better here. You&#39;ll be skating, passing, drawing penalties -- well, abstractly.   I like the fact that your team is trying to score on a goalie. Although all players (of the game, not hockey players) are scoring on the same goalie, it reminds me of pond shinny, so I can look past this. Anyhow, when you score, take that goalie. The one with the most goalies at the end wins.  The concept of defenders, adding to the &#39;power&#39; of the goaltender is one of the more fascinating aspects. Do you attempt a shot on an goalie with 11 power when you only have 11 as well? What if your opponents play defenders?  Fake shots, tricking your opponent to play a powerful defender, is an interesting tactic.  Long story short, if you are a hockey fan looking for a light deck-builder, give this a shot. Don&#39;t bother with DC Deck-Builder; there are many superior superhero deck-builders on the market.  -----  Note: I only started tracking in January of 2017, so please ignore the play count.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#34;A good solid game.  Plenty to think about.  Reminds me a little of Condottiere - the &#39;feel&#39; of the gambles you make...  Good game!&#34;, 8.),

 (&#39;Obviously inspired by Sid Meier\&#39;s Civilization (computer game), this conversion to a board/card game works much better than Eagle\&#39;s earlier attempt. Much more abstract and without a map, this version still has players building and tailoring their &#34;civilization&#34; according to their inclinations and drafting cards that support the direction they wish to take (or sometimes the reverse).  As in so many games lately, the player is regulated by an &#34;action drafting&#34; system where each action involves making choices between many options. The game is essentially one of constructing a victory point engine from the opportunities the game presents.  The game consists of three levels: &#34;simple,&#34; &#34;advanced&#34; and &#34;full.&#34; The simple game involves very little player interaction and serves mainly to introduce all the moving parts. The advanced game adds more to the game and can involve more player interaction (a lot more if all the optional rules are adopted). The game requires several playings to appreciate the flow and card interactions. With a full four players, the advanced game becomes quite long - the full game would be epic (and since being simply more of the same, I\&#39;m not sure the full game will ever need to be played except by fanatics). Three players may be the sweet spot (and I\&#39;ve not tried two players).  The player interaction, when it occurs, consists of taking &#34;military actions&#34; such as playing an &#34;aggression&#34; card which represents a raid or skirmish between two players with the winner being the one with the higher total military strength. In this, the defender has a slight advantage being the only one able to play &#34;defense cards&#34; he may hold. Attacking may mean committing to lose some expensive military units, so doing so (unless almost certain of winning) seems to be a needless gamble. In practice, it means that a player will attack the weakest opponent rather than your nearest competitor and thus tends not to be a particularly useful tool (and a possible design flaw). Nothing would frustrate a player more than investing several hours to his civilization only to see it savaged by an opportunist. So far in our games we haven\&#39;t seen a lot of this sort of &#34;take that&#34; play - but we can see the possibility of this becoming an important element.  Another related aspect of player interaction is the competition for colonies and new territories where lucrative resources are acquired by bidding military units against the other players. However, as successfully doing so could leave you vulnerable to aggression, it becomes a very calculated risk.  It occurs to me that most players drawn to this game will be those who see this as a Euro version of Civ. The cutthroat nature of the player interaction may prove to be a turn off for many of those. So far I\&#39;m liking it (but have yet to see or feel the full force of the nasty things players can inflict on each other).  You have been warned - Caveat Emptor! ++++++ After an extended hiatus, I\&#39;ve had a chance to revisit this game and must admit to the genius of its design. I still think three players is the sweet spot but my hesitance about the military side of the game is proving unfounded. It is integral and self-balancing, and will be visited a lot or a little depending on the group dynamic but the game will stand up either way. Truly impressive!&#39;, 10.),

 (&#34;I very much enjoy the game, but since it treads the same ground as GBOH, it is inevitable that I compare the two as I play.  GBOH is a far, far better system.  Ok, the GBOH battles take a lot longer, but you just have so many more decisions. I can see why games like C&amp;C: Ancients, Battle Cry, and Memoir &#39;44 have fans and I am going to enjoy playing C&amp;C: Ancients with light wargamers, but there is just no way that the wealth of GBOH will be eclipsed anytime soon.  Update: I raised this 0.25 just because everyone I play with enjoys the game.  One thing that C&amp;C:A outclasses GBOH in is the number of opponents!!! &#34;, 8.),

 (&#34;This game is so caught up in my memories of DnD, and non-Avalon Hill games (Ogre, Asteroid, Terrible Green Things) that I don&#39;t know how I would rate it now. So my rating is based off of my memory of what I felt back in 1981. Back then I loved it. It fired the imagination this map with its kingdoms and groups. I do remember that the start was problematic. Played one game that ended on turn 2. Would probably never choose to play, but appreciate the memories.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;I did not find this game to be particularly interesting.  Yes, money is tight, auctions take place, and you ponder how much money you are making relative to other players through the share selections, share auctions, and dividend mechanics, but none of this rises above being of moderate interest.  (Perhaps I am just not a train loving gamer.)    The rest of the game mechanics: building tracks and improving hexes feel like uninteresting adjuncts, as they served little purpose other than to feed into the &#34;division of dividends&#34; mechanic which as stated, was just not that interesting to me.  I would rather play RR Tycoon (or even Steam I suppose) than this.&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;2800 Base + All expansion&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Only played scenario 1 solo once, but really liked the system. Components are fantastic. Seems very solo friendly, except for mines, hidden units and the like. My one complaint is I really, really don´t like generic maps, but I realise that they are pretty much the norm in tactical WW II games. At least this map feels less generic since it´s not several geomorphic boards with two road exits on each side. More historical background would have been nice. In ASL and ATS scenarios you get about twice as much, with the historical outcome added. The mousepad player mats, available separately, are surprisingly helpful in solo play. For one thing you have all the tracks gathered in a small area, rather than on opposite sides of a huge mapboard. Scale: 50 m per hex.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;It was a nigh-perfect game before. It is practically a perfect game now :)  Yes it&#39;s long. Yes the card draft is random. Yes it can be frustrating.  But the strategic depth is unparalleled, and the satisfaction when a plan comes together is epic.&#34;, 10.),
 (&#39;An utterly themeless multiplayer solitaire a resource efficiency game.   An optimization puzzle where your choices are constrained by the presence of tracks that interlock.  The point of it all: convert resources you gain from going up the various tracks into VPs. What you do on your turn? Go up a track and do what the space of the track affords you.   In terms of it being a &#34;civ builder,&#34; Tapestry is utterly devoid of any of the trappings of an actual civ game. It has the ever-so-thinnest veneer of tech and military and so forth, but it\&#39;s slapped on with water soluble paint that strips off with a sideways glance. Calling this a civ game is an absolute joke.  The level of player interaction is limited to racing up tracks, racing to spots, and the occasional &#34;toppling&#34; of another player\&#39;s piece, an event so rare that doing it twice in over the course of a game is one of the three major scoring goals available in every game.  The resource-and-VP-producing Capital city spatial puzzle is tacked on and annoying.  There is a weird de facto player elimination system where players can end their games 20+ minutes before anyone else does. Which I consider mercy for the player who gets to bow out early.   All in all, here is a game with nothing innovative or interesting.&#39;, 3.),

Neighborhood bonuses are perhaps the most interesting element, as the order in which they are revealed can entirely change the relative value of surrounding tiles.

Not so with Blue Moon City.  Based on attributes such as its variable board, production quality, ease of play, and such, I think Blue Moon City does warrant relatively high ratings, but my own experience of the game goes beyond objective analysis -- I just find it really fun.

 (&#34;First impressions: This may be the tactical minis game for me. There&#39;s a great ominous feel to the gameplay, where something bad definitely always is around the corner. It&#39;s tough and in turn tense, though perhaps not quite so tense when the marines incorporate respawning into their strategy. Then again, you can&#39;t lean on that a lot. Respawning is really the only thing so far that I find gamey, but I don&#39;t mind it really. It can&#39;t be imagined into the story easily (edit: well, more or less), but it&#39;s honestly the only thing I had to turn a blind eye to. Great fun!  After playing Earth Reborn and Forlorn: Hope, two prime challengers to Doom in my book, I&#39;ve decided to pursue Doom. You can see more of why in my comments for both of those games, but suffice to say here that Doom stands squarely between the best of both of those titles. It&#39;s as simple as F:H but has the visual appeal and random scenario generation of ER. It&#39;s longer than F:H but forces a lot less action point counting than ER, the adding up of numbers being a necessity instead of a thrill.  Now that I&#39;ve played Doom a few times as well, I can say my impressions stand. This game is fun with minimal fuss albeit fiddly at times.

 (&#34;as the rules are written the game has a horrible downtime. yet it is interesting enough to just SCREAM for variant to make it playable. perhaps play it like group scrabble with everyone thinking about the same position, perhaps show some monsters &#39;done&#39; and an elder one, and have people race who finds a way to play the elder one, or a ricochet robots variant where you show many aliens and one elder one, and people try to find fewest aliens needed to put the elder one in play.  in any case, if you want to play the game without variants the downtime&#39;ll kill you, and if if doesn&#39;t the randomness will.&#34;, 4.),
 (&#39;Too swingy.  Medium, Avg weight: 2.4&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;I played this twice and I think it&#39;s really a nice little game. We decided to just learn it from the rulebook (which was surprisingly easy and not something I tend to do at cons) and bashed through in a surprisingly short time for the player count.  I quite like it, but I&#39;d need to play it a couple more times before buying because I suspect it&#39;s a little dry and samey.&#34;, 6.),

 (&#39;Watch out - the base game comes with only 4 scenarios out of 22 shown in the app. All the other require buying additional content, either software on Steam or extensions, which is unacceptable, especially given the price tag.&#39;, 3.),
 (&#39;The rules in English translation were not intuitive.  Flow was missing.  The game is quite innovative and fun.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;:Wii-:&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;First the bads: the map is functional, but notreally good enough - I want more areas to hide and seek... Also, the map does not lend itself to a what-if strategic replay ( it was not designed for this, but it could have been fun with a German naval base in Africa, say, or moreraidersfrom the North Sea) There are not enough scenarios. There IS great variety and re-play value in the main scenario, but there ought to be more of them.  The good: very exciting replay of the great hide-and-seek on a global level. Play balance is good and the system with activating convoys works well, although tere could have been more of them, such assmaller, local convoys.&#39;, 7.),

 (&#34;Gameplay is slow and the rules are sometimes unintuitive, but there&#39;s a lot here to think about and a fantastic sense of history as well. My rating may go up as I get more plays in and more familiarity with the rules.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;When I played this game, there was some end of the game gridlock, stemming largely from the combat system, and it totally seized up play.  Otherwise, it was pretty fun.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Pretty good game. Popular with the kids. Medium popular with the adults.&#39;, 8.),

 (&#39;Way, way to much luck, even for a dice game;  Nearly deleted the App from my IPad&#39;, 3.),
 (&#39;Clever little game about time travel. Forty or so cards form a timeline on the table, and these cards are either Linchpins or Paradoxes. Linchpins flip to ripple the Paradox, so for example the Titanic may have missed the iceberg and caused changes to events further down the timeline. To win, players must either find their own version of time (ie. flip Paradoxes and &amp;quot;patch&amp;quot; them), collect 3 hysterical artifacts, or build their hand size (by patching Paradoxes) up to ten cards. Great fun, but a little chaotic and Fluxx-y. &#39;, 5.),
 (&#34;I dont really enjoy this game, and it wouldnt be my first choice to play. While i like the minor tension it creates, i don&#39;t feel there is really much strategy or interaction and thus it&#39;s not really on the top of my MUST own titles. I can see how this maybe a good introduction for people how haven&#39;t played any boardgames outside the classic hasbro titles, but from a gamers perspective this is mindless.  also worth noting that my group is 5 people...and i would imagine this game is better suited for less people &#34;, 6.),

 (&#39;This game is awesome. I often use it as a gateway game. &#39;, 8.),

 (&#34;Despite a pleasing thematic gloss, Three Kingdoms is a eurogame with worker placement, production engine building, a touch of area control, and a veritable Chef&#39;s Salad of points, with nine things scoring at game end.  Battles there are at the borders between the three clans, but they boil down to bidding contests.    Three Kingdoms adds interest to dull old worker placement in two ways.  First, each worker is a general with three different stats.   Some actions demand combat ability, others administration, while going into battle calls for combat and leadership.  On top of that, every general has a different special ability.  An important part of the game is to exploit that ability as much as possible and to find effective ways of combining it with others and with enhancements.  Second, in the early game contesting an action or a border area does not seem critical - indeed, in Three Kingdoms&#39; all or nothing world it risks being wasteful.  In the late game, with time running out and end game points clearly at stake, there is much more contesting and this begins to feel more like a bidding game.   Three Kingdoms also asks tricky questions about when to station a general on the border.  Area control of your two borders is an end game scorer, while military presence there scores points every turn.  On the other hand, stationing a general robs you of a worker and, quite likely, their special ability.  And you need to pay their troops with rice and gold.    The game&#39;s point salady nature does present strategic choices, since focusing on a few of the ways to score is essential.    For a first published design, Three Kingdoms is remarkably polished.  The one element that could have used more work is the enhancements that offer end game vps, often with a condition for building that is only likely to be met in the early game.  Drew one of those later on?  Hard luck.  The artwork is outstanding.  The only misstep was with the army counters, whose trained and untrained sides look too darned similar and evoke ducks more than soldiers.  Production quality of my Capstone edition is very good.  The rules are fine, with a good use of examples.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;Definitely not one for the heavy cardboard fans but as a lighter game, this really up there. Beautiful story telling element makes it great for casual play and families.  Would highly recommend.&#39;, 7.),

 (&#34;A game with so many possibilities that it is a bit overwhelming. But that makes it a reason to play it more. Difficult to play the first time although the rules are clear enough. It&#39;s the choices that makes it difficult.&#34;, 9.),
 (&#34;I like this game. It&#39;s easy and fun. Only disappointment are the graphics and the story.  95% of the game is olive/ sand-color.  It looks really blunt.  And what about lemmings wanting to kill them selfs by jumping in the water? Is that something from the cartoon? To me it would have made more sense if there was a boat and the &#39;mafia&#39;lemming that won would have escaped the police or something.  ..&#34;, 8.),
 (&#34;I&#39;m really divided over this. On the one hand I love it for being a Star Wars minis game with upgradeable characters, and fairly understandable rules. On the other hand I&#39;m less impressed with the scenarios as written. Go to terminal, shoot at terminal, ignore stormtroopers stood around you in a semicircle blasting the crap out of you, win. I&#39;d have liked some refinement that is lacking maybe due to a desire to get the product on the shelves, but there is a little bit of a &#39;that&#39;ll do&#39; feeling about the campaign.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;Received in Dice Tower Cruise Goodie bag for 2017.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Was quite excited for this Legacy version after loving both Pandemic seasons... BUT, the publisher mixed up the contents of the two secret boxes... WTF, how does that even happen?!? Dumb mistake that ruined the whole game.&#39;, 3.),
 (&#39;Best played with Jason Raynovich, and make sure he invokes Ra.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;The Bottle Imp is a thematically driven &#34;trick-taking&#34; game. The concept of experiencing wealth when your cards are higher then the bottle and despair when you can\&#39;t get rid of the bottle is so intriguing.&#39;, 7.),

 (&#39;Rules are very hard to understand&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;Awesome game. I love how the random events are build into the system so as to provide a different experience every time you play. For now, my preferred squad-level war game.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Fun little two player game. I really enjoy it but there are better games out there. Loved the camels and spice trade feel&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;aesthetics: 1/2 mechanics: 1/2 replayability: 2/2 rules grit: 2/2 theme: 0/2&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Think Dog Breeding and Dog Shows and the game makes all the sense in the world.  Otherwise nice light game that plays quickly (especially after the first play) and is a nice filler with moderate decisions each turn.  I do wonder how likely it is to win by gaining the cash instead of breeding the top dog (err Golden Gnome).&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;Heavy, playable spreadsheet with 17 incredibly dense decisions to make. There is a lot to consider in your turn, which is strange because the only thing you do is pick a single building to place into your city.  The pacing is incredibly slow, almost herky-jerky. It&#39;s not about downtime so much as it is about how does this game take so damn long to play?   The interlocking tracks make it feel like a Lacerda wanna-be, but it&#39;s very dry and feels MPS despite the conceit that the tracks are supposed to be the competitive driver. Somehow, it&#39;s a very solitary experience.  It&#39;s not a bad game, but it&#39;s not particularly fun. &#34;, 3.),
 (&#39;7 Juni 2013 Great Lakes Game Emporium  I am giddy over this game right now, but that might be due to the fact that we just won. Which actually concerns me a bit as I am not sure there will be a ton of variation.  I will update after I have a few dozen games under my belt.  I love that it is a quick, easy to learn, cooperative game.  The tiles are beautiful, and the play is innovative.    &#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;Better than Dominion. There are actually some strategies to develop and the choices aren&#39;t always obvious. Very easy to learn (mechanics are straightforward). After the second play I thought the game was simply too easy. What makes this game work is that the players must work together to make certain the &#39;bad guys&#39; don&#39;t win but when the game is over each player scores the victory points earned during the game so there is a single winner. Some of the cards will alter the victory points earned which can alter a player&#39;s decisions during the game.   This is not a deep game but it is fun and certainly better than Dominion.  Note: as I do not follow comic books, I played the game by the numbers and the powers on the cards. I was not even certain who some of the characters were on the cards.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;Interesting engine builder.  Of course, some luck in the cards you draw.  Do what you can with them.&#39;, 6.),

 (&#34;The Dice Tower seem to be fans of this game, but I think it is just pretty solidly OK.  I can&#39;t fault the artwork and production, it&#39;s really excellent. The gameplay is where the game let me down. Sometimes the choice of dice order or card is interesting, but most of the time it&#39;s pretty automatic. You might be lucky to have a great hand, or unlucky to be stuck with useless cards.  I think there are better pirate games and better race games.&#34;, 6.),

 (&#39;I finally got this to the table and its something I enjoy quite a bit. Its kind of a silly pandemic replacement. It plays really quick and I like the time mechanic and how its implemented. &#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;A little too long for its own good, though I suppose experience with the game would speed it up a bit.  I like the bluffing element as well as the dice bowling part, which feels thematic and is wacky enough to be fun, but still requires a bit of skill to do well.  I am a little troubled by the restrictions on who can call the player&#39;s bluff, as in my experience it is quite risky to call out another player, and we seemed to avoid it more often than I&#39;d like.  Not the type of game you play all the time, but every once in a while, with the full complement of players, it&#39;s a lot of fun!&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;Missing one counter.&#39;, 4.),
 (&#34;Creating a quick card game out of blackjack is a great idea, but unfortunately Office 21 falls short of being a good game.   For such a short game Office 21&#39;s clunky rules are much too long with plenty of exceptions and other unnecessary complications. Its cards rely on half thought out iconography which doesn&#39;t make much sense (see Guildhall for an example of iconography done right).

 (&#34;There is engine building and racing. This is exactly my type of game. Trading is tense and fun. Trying to gather the needed cards while they are getting snagged is enjoyable. Overall really underrated game that probably many people don&#39;t know because it is not available.  &#34;, 8.),
 (&#34;Original plan was to keep his around as it is a hallmark game that I hope to give proper playing time when my son reaches the age of 12+  Do have a friend that loves this game, but that is also the problem. He&#39;ll play your side as well. Also, he also owns the game so there goes a reason to keep it around.  [FEB14] As my gaming collection definitely needs a tone-down, and I have more than enough other games to play with my kids, this goes for trade (for sale as well).  [JUNE15] Sold.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;I like the structure of the crafting, but it all gets muddled by the overly complicated rules.  It needed to be more streamlined. Having the buildings color coded and money required color coded also is a bit too much. Artwork looks great. Play length was too long in my opinion. There is fun to be had, but not without some frustration.&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;A tile-laying game played with cards, this one really appeals despite my usual aversion to abstracts. Hanging Gardens moves along rapidly and players do not seem to get bogged down in the puzzle aspect of card placement. Falls squarely into the lighter-fare camp, which in this case is a big plus.&#39;, 7.),

 (&#34;Spend most of the game fighting for food, rating might go up as the noobishness wears off and I develop better strategies. EDIT: After a few more plays, I had to drop this to a 7, the play style on this game just annoys me, unfortunately, some of my friends like this enough that I&#39;m sure it will get a few more plays, fortunately, that may give me time to pinpoint exactly what it is that bugs me about this.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;It is fun as a nostalgic, retro game. It has too much target the runaway leader. Not a deep game at all.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;Great game only it can get a bit long in the tooth when you find yourself waiting it out for the base star to arrive.  It is a brilliant game for &#39;who&#39;s the cylon&#39; tension, but the hang up lies in not having a good flow for battle.  It could be fixed by maybe having more cards with a base star or more frequent &#39;attack&#39; cards? who knows.  Best bit though is trying to figure out the cylon...lots of action man eye movement sussing each other out.&#34;, 8.),

 (&#39;Designer: Martin Wallace  A Study in Emerald is a textbook example of why you don\&#39;t buy games that don\&#39;t scale well. In this case, this game, I would argue, is unplayable with 2. Certainly, if you play with 2, you won\&#39;t be getting the full effect. What\&#39;s more, it devolves into a tit-for-tat struggle for control of cities (which incidentally only comprises a small portion of the game). In this way, the game is downright broken with 2. I don\&#39;t recommend trying it at that level, even for practice. That said, I do like the game. There\&#39;s a lot of cool mechanisms involved. The art is gorgeous. The production is quite good and the theme is fresh (albeit strange). I like the &#34;idea&#34; of the game so much that I\&#39;m considering holding onto it for a few years just to see it I can get 4-5 to play it. Although I have not played it with 3, I don\&#39;t think it would be good at that level either. So, even if you use the Agent Sunday variant on BGG, I don\&#39;t think the game is going to live up to its full potential. The end-game scoring conditions really distinguish this game and without their implementation, I don\&#39;t think it\&#39;s going to be anything special. All in all, terrible for 2, but could be magnificent with 4-5 (if they are gamers). In other words, this is a niche game that should only appeal to a very select crowd with an established group.   Rating is based on expected gameplay with 4-5.  Update: 3 days later.....I can\&#39;t stop thinking about this game!  Long-term Keeper: Yes—-Why? I just can’t get rid of it. It’s an OOP Wallace game with beautiful components. &#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;The rating is for Dominion + all the expansions.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;Slightly more complex than FITS and, as a result, not quite as fun.  Still a decent game, though, and definitely great as an educational challenge for children.&#39;, 5.),

 (&#39;Best football game ever&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Great little game, much harder then you think! And of course, the children always win...&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;Long game where the end sneaks up on you.  At the beginning it seems like you have a million actions ahead of you, and then all of a sudden you realize you&#39;ve only got seven actions left in the game.  Playing with experienced players is a real plus, as the first few games can be excruciatingly long (at least if you&#39;re playing with me).  I like two-player, since it&#39;s quick(er) and it&#39;s your turn so often.  Three seems like it could be good, as well.  The four-player games have taken so long, that I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d want to play with that count again.  13 games in, and it&#39;s feeling a little samey (at least in two player games).  Maybe it&#39;s just that the two of us are stuck in groupthink, but it seems like there are a fixed number of strategies.  I keep playing this, although I&#39;m not sure why.  Seems like a lot of time for only a little payoff in fun/brainwork.  I ended up trading this, and am not looking to play it again.  It feels like there are several better options out there.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;Gorgeous game, original concept, but a bit too clunky for its own good.  Had some fun with it back in the day, though.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Gettysburg in monster-fashion using the late Richard Berg\&#39;s &#34;Great Battles of the American Civil War&#34; system. One could dedicate the better part of several weeks playing this through to a conclusion. Highly recommended to round up a few mates to make a go at this. As with many Gettysburg games, it is very difficult for the CSA player(s) to drive the USA player(s) back through the town (or force their withdrawal) to get the battle re-oriented on the historical north-south axis south of the town. In our plays, the battle has typically been decided by late-afternoon of the second day on an east-west axis perpendicular to the ridge-lines, frequently with a CSA withdrawal to fight another day (as Longstreet advocated). If one has the time to dedicate, it doesn\&#39;t get much better than this.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#34;A pretty good game that shows both battles well IMHO.  For the WW1 game, illustrates the issues facing the RN in the South Atlantic.  For the 1982 version, the strengths and weaknesses of the various aircraft and ships are simply-and elegantly done.  I&#39;ve played it quite a few times over the years, and found it well balanced.  &#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;Hmmm.... that games will never belong to my collection. Testes in Essen with 4 players and we did even not finish it.&#39;, 4.),
 (&#39;Does what I like a card game to do: gives you agonizing decisions to make with very little rules overhead. &#39;, 7.),

 (&#39;Interesting area control game with a lot of variety. Feels like Gamers Risk with the variable player powers.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Roligt spel, dock måste man vara.många för att leva upp till betyget. Är man många dock är det väldigt tråkigt när man åker ut eller om sällskapet inte kan hålla fokus. Finns bättre spel som.kräver mindre &#39;, 6.),

 (&#39;Probably my favorite board game.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;Fun racing game....&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;After 5+ Plays: I really like the underlying system - interesting tension between what is best spatially, and what is best strategically.  A lack of interesting interaction between players keeps this from a higher rating.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Very addictive because of multipe game mechanics : majority,  auction, deck (in fact coin) building. Very little randomness so no luck necessary.  Fair graphics and beautiful illustrations, with some background work. Simple to install, fast to play (but no apéro game ^^). Adapt to 2 to 5 players as well (perhaps with two remove Uline and Thrud, because of unbalancing).&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;A unique blend of Carcassonne, Settlers of Catan, and Civilization, Archipelago combines cooperation, economics, building, and subtlety in order to hide your victory condition while trying to deduce that of others.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Not a bad memory game for the age range (7 &amp; up). Apart from the inital set up where your board is laid out by another player, there is no player interaction. That isn\&#39;t to say that it\&#39;s not a distraction when you\&#39;re giggling at them as they &#34;can\&#39;t find that last smegging gold coin!&#34; ;)  Needs beer... er... Rum!&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;Cool theme but strategy feels random and can lead to major analysis paralysis.&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;I can&amp;#039;t get enough of this game.  Features various agendas, various strengths and abilities.  My cup of tea.  But you never know how long the game will last.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;With: Boss decks Lich &amp; The Dragon; Character packs Cleric, Fighter, Ranger, Thief, and Wizard; Captain Koska promo card;  and The Ruin of Thandar Campaign Deck.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;The second edition rules make this game a blast to play, and it teaches pretty easily to my non-wargaming friends.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;This game holds some nostalgic value.  The play can get repetitive but I still find it fun.  Strategy is limited, and there is some luck involved, but it was one of the games that taught me how to &#34;search&#34; a grid.  My hunch is that this would be a great game to analyze probabilities.&#39;, 5.),
 (&#34;Excellent deduction game with a gripping theme! Fast paced and easy to learn, this little beauty will capture your gaming friends&#39; imagination straight away. Recommended! &#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;I actually disliked this game more than Scrabble.   &#39;, 1.),
 (&#39;Time have outrunned it. But I have good memories about this game.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Yikes!&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;Cosmic encounter is another one of those games that does well when there is a healthy level of negotiation going on. You need to get 5 colonies set up, but the cards make it so that you’re going to have a really hard time doing so unless you’re exploiting your race’s power properly and working well with the table. It felt like the game got very stagnant as soon as someone hit 4 colonies, but I’m not sure if we were playing with all the correct rules. I would play this again just to explore the different strategies offered by the various races.&#39;, 3.),
 (&#39;random dice fest&#39;, 4.),
 (&#39;&#34;I\&#39;ve played GridIron Master several times with some friends.  The concept is very unique.  A great game for any football strategy buff.&#34; - Phil Frazier, Madden NFL Lead Producer, EA Sports&#39;, 10.),
 (&#39;Gateway drug, I mean game....&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Played!&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;So fun. Great story. Rules take a little bit to understand fully but once you do this game becomes one you want to get back to the table as often as possible.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;Received PnP. Thank you PnP Secret Santa &#39;13! &#34;, 4.),
 (&#34;Takes over two hours. Too long for what it is.  The last show is too important. I probably play it one more time and try to get last in the first shows.  There is some tactical play as well but these can be found in set collection games with cards for a much lower price and that actually offer more decision making in  30 minutes.  The game is beautifully produced by Dow. And now TMG is having a kickstarter. It looks to be another greatly produced game.  I can&#39;t recommend it because it takes too long to be an enjoyable family game. You can have 2 games of Ticket to ride instead.&#34;, 5.),
 (&#39;cost rating A&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;I&#39;ve enjoyed the online implementation and I suspect this is where the game shines as play feels a bit fiddly and slow, though I see it as an ideal candidate for addition for older kids.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;This is turning out to be my favorite Command and Colors game. The system works very well in this setting.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#34;One of my favorite games back in the days, but too much investment (both time and cost). With the retrospective, I think I consider this game more as a sand box experience with a framework more than an actual board game experience. The game system is pretty bad when you think about it. It&#39;s meant to be a simulation but it just makes the game so slow, and leads to crazy situations more than often. I think building an army is the most interesting part of the game, then the rest is just a huge dice battle. There is almost no strategy once you have placed your units on the map. Feels like a football manager game, where the team is set and strategy is set, then you let the CPU roll the dice for your games.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;Have a big problem with the final battle, its waaaay to random for all the buildup you go through the entire game.&#39;, 5.),
 (&#34;It is difficult to do anything that benefits you directly, and that&#39;s fantastic. Could go higher.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;Good game.  I was actually not interested in this game prior to playing, the game is a lot more fun than it looks from a spectators view.&#39;, 7.),

 (&#34;Not much depth here, but it&#39;s good fun running amok with the monsters, and unlike many in this genre it doesn&#39;t overstay it&#39;s welcome.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;great lunchtime game.  little box with a big game inside!  the inclusion of expansions in the base game combined with a simple fun theme lets this get busted out and played over my lunch hour.  i love the simplicity of it &#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;This game was something of a pleasant surprise for me.  In general, I don&#39;t particularly care of trivia games at this stage in my life.  For one, my work revolves around recalling too much minutiae for it to be something pleasant for me to do in my time off.  Beyond that, it is just really hard to come up with a trivia game that is easily balanced among the people playing.  It is on the latter that this game truly excels.  In my experience, rarely is the person who is the most expert in trivia the one who wins this game.  That is fine by me.  Even the totally clueless can do well if they guess right (or manage to blindly follow the appropriate people).  All in all, I find this game to be fun to play as opposed to the mental masturbation that most trivia games are at heart.  [02/17/2008]&#34;, 8.),
 (&#34;It&#39;s okay I guess but I don&#39;t think its for me. &#34;, 5.),
 (&#39;Nice little abstract game, gets marked up for its length. But the title in English is naff to say the least. What\&#39;s wrong with &#34;Penguins&#34;?&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Has to be played with 4-5 players to be fun. 3 may be for teaching purposes, but gets imbalanced. &#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;Classic AT game.  The theme is quite well done, and there is a degree of strategy in trying to corner the humans (or stay away from the zombies long enough to get well-armed), but certainly a fair amount of roll and move and player elimination.  Not a bad game, but nothing spectacular, in my opinion.  UPDATE: Dropping to a 5 as I can&#39;t see me usually willing to play this.&#34;, 5.),
 (&#34;Its just kinda meh. Mostly purchased it for the HeroClix, but would&#39;ve been nice to get a fun game out of it. &#34;, 4.),
 (&#39;Traded for Wildlands&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Excellent solo game. A lot of fun and easy to play. &#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;A real classic. This game is adorably cutthroat and comfortably straight forward.&#39;, 4.),
 (&#39;Really a fantastic tableau builder.  The &#34;move down the line&#34; mechanism for comboing cards is so brilliant.  Love this game!  (oh yeah, and maybe the best art in the business and a theme my wife will actually play).&#39;, 10.),
 (&#34;I give this one a 9 because it&#39;s not the MOST fun game i&#39;ve ever played, and even though we don&#39;t play it often anymore it still is THE best gateway game in my opinion.  I can honestly say that I have never had anyone DISLIKE this game after playing it.  It&#39;s usually they&#39;re first REAL boardgame and it ends up being the best one they&#39;ve ever played. Edit (2/4/13):  I&#39;ve changed my ranking from a 9 to a 6.  I&#39;ve grown so tired of this game that I cringe when someone suggests it.  It is a good game, but there are so many better games that I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re still playing this as a group.   &#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;Interresting concept but not my cup of tea.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;+ nice interaction through blocking of action (standard for workerplacement)  - nice theme, but it does not give the game much to it - static board - no big replayability -- no feedback if the strategy is good -- point-calculation in the end  Special: This was after Targi my first Workerplacement Game &#39;, 5.),
 (&#34;Great art again, and the theme here appeals to me more than Tides of Time, but I&#39;ve kept both sets. The addition of Madness gives you another obstacle to think about, which this fast, fluid game benefits from.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;smjj loves this game therefore I hate it :p&#39;, 1.),
 (&#39;Card&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;Fast tile laying game that inserts trade-offs everywhere, from tile selection, to tile placement, to tableau size, to buying/selling goods. Some additional, but related, aspects of engine building, partial engine activation, and player tempo provide some tactical layers. Stays nicely simple, and brief, so it&#39;s approachable to many. Solid. Wants three or four players to be at its best, so the various differential scorings have a bit more potential and to increase competition over the specializations into certain tile colors.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#34;This is a fun race game. I really like pre-programming your robot&#39;s moves. It can drag on with too long of a course, though, so keep the number of boards as low as possible.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#34;Fantastic war game. Outstandingly simple rules for this type of game, yet it does not feel dumbed down in any way. Support for almost everything you&#39;d expect in a squad level war game. Components are as good as they can get.&#34;, 9.),
 (&#39;This was my first Kickstarter and I was eager to play it. Sold after one play because it did not live up to my expectations. The gameplay does not convey the theme, the art on cards has a very generic fantasy look, and the process feels quite repetitive. Also the box is too big :)&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;A great game that suffers from a few flaws.  Firstly it has a lot of downtime.  There&#39;s very little to do while your opponent is thinking and not much point planning since the board changes radically after each turn.  Few interrupt cards as well and you can&#39;t even look at your hand until the start of your turn, i.e. more downtime.  Another problem is that it&#39;s only two player so doesn&#39;t hit the table that much, and although the Master Set comes from a great board, I wouldn&#39;t say the game is great value for money.  Unless you&#39;re hungry for tactical card games with a fantasy theme I wouldn&#39;t recommend this, despite it being a pretty cool game.  UPDATE: I&#39;d recommend Mage Wars over this game pretty much every time... &#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;Great fun! Five players with the special cards in. Played it four times the first night. Love the artwork. Update: played without the special cards with 3players, seemed to have more control and a more engaging game. Higher player counts, the special cards make it more entertaining and random. Lower player count, without the special cards make it a clever little card game with more tension. Love it! Will prefer to play it at lower player counts from now on.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;Entertaining enough (for a while), but ... it isn&#39;t a *game*! Players do solitaire puzzles in parallel, and afterwards determine who did best. Yes, I know the trend has been towards lesser and more indirect player interaction in eurogames in recent years, but this is ridiculous!&#34;, 3.),
 (&#34;[comment after 1 play]  The gimmick in this game (or in an effort to save cardboard) was that instead of little tokens to indicate buildings, people, resources, etc. you draw on your board with a dry erase marker. It is a simple yahtzee like game where you throw 3 times, but there are a lot of different ways of scoring.  It was interesting and fun, but I have the nagging feeling that it is a light game designed for non-gamers, but with so many different little rules that the non-gamers won&#39;t like it. &#34;, 7.),
 (&#34;Who knew capture the flag could be turned into a decent board game. The programmed movement makes sense, but the fact that this is essentially a 4-player game because if you have less someone is always playing multiple hands makes this less enjoyable for me. The excitement comes from 2 players sharing a 3-person team and running into each other and essentially causing each other grief. One person controlling the 3-player team can avoid all of that. If we ever had 4 I&#39;d consider playing it because I do think it has some variability with the player powers and variants included, which is nice. The other knock for me is the components seem really small, this is a game that could have great table presence if only the board and cardboard/wood components were bigger.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;It is good, not great&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;I need to give this a couple more plays, but I found it to be fairly unimpressive.   Update: Dull, dull, dull. Packed away in a &#34;crap box&#34; (box of crappy games) to make room on the shelf for a game that DOESN\&#39;T suck. I got this game only because some reviewer of the original &#34;218&#34; game said he spent hours playing it whle in college. Must\&#39;ve been some kind of remedial college for the easily amused.&#39;, 3.),
 (&#34;By far my favorite game of all time. And I&#39;ve only been playing it about a two years. It&#39;s everything I ever wanted in a game and gaming community and more. If you haven&#39;t played it, please try? It&#39;s complex and confusing, but so worth putting the effort into.&#34;, 10.),

 (&#34;I&#39;m sorry but this game rocks!  We play pub Uno and vary the rules continuously... put down a zero and pass your deck to the left... I&#39;ve loved this game from the age of 4. &#34;, 10.),
 (&#34;A bit more thinky than the original. I would say it&#39;s not deeper, but it offers more paths. The gameplay is satisfying, although the scoring round can drag a bit with a high player count.  Sadly, the strategic choices are limited. You will always try to score the low numbers and 1-2 colours.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;I feel like I am constantly waiting for my number to come up in a harvest roll ...&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Starts to repeat itself very quickly&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;recently played a 6 person game and it was pretty crazy, took a bit longer, but was still really fun for all.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Light dice game. It plays quickly.   However there is strong runaway leader feel to it. So once your economy starts to get traction there is not much others can do.   I would probably not turn down game of this but I would definitely not ask for it. &#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;[u]Pros[/u]: * Large hexes * Road Network * Command and Supply * Frontline thingies * Interactive combat system, but unfortunately not for movement. * Combat system is a nice experiment  [u]Cons[/u]: * Plastics instead of counters. Historical identification and differentiated unit data could then have been displayed. * Battle is a front line instead of the bulge-shape. So no Pattons counterattack from Luxemburg in northern direction. * Too much supply * Unlimited roadmovement is allowed. Traffic jams was common in the Battle. I won one game as the German by driving through an hole in the line, taking 24 points at once. So ... keep your line closed! * No encirclement of Bastogne happens. * Too few units in a hex leads to an almost certain destruction. * Too many units in a hex leads to an almost certain hold. Some units have to retreat, but they can return the next turn. * Why not everything interactive. 8 turns is very limited in achieving goals. * Since the Allies may move last, he decides where battles take place and where to avoid them. * Victory conditions are too flat. If the Germans can&#39;t get 24 points, there is not much left for him to play for, once the Allies are pushing him back. * I believe the game favours the Allies.  In short ... a missed opportunity for a decent Bulge game. &#34;, 5.),
 (&#34;My god do I Love this game.  It just lands right in my wheel-house.  It was quite a year for Stronghold Games with this one AND Terraforming Mars.  It seems like most people seemed to favor the later, but I am solidly in the GWT camp.  I think it&#39;s a more compelling game (and a prettier one to boot)  I love the hand/deck management aspect with the cattle and how the board changes based on how players build out the trail.  Lots of ways to win, lots of things to try.  So so good.&#34;, 10.),
 (&#34;I&#39;m not much for Clue, but I&#39;ll play this (mostly because it&#39;s shorter).&#34;, 5.),
 (&#39;Looks marvelous with the flags and the board setup. The first in the c&amp;c system and a very good game. Love the leaders.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Yeah, a bit like Dixit. Ehile Dixit works better with the right bunch of people (creative minds with a talent for words and communication), but works worse with the wrong group, Mysterium works with anyone. Love the concept, adore the graphics.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;All the good bits of Agricola (worker placement and the growing economic engine) without the parts I detest (the overdependence on card draw and the paucity of choices).  Very good with three players.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Puntuación BGG 7,6 Peso 3,16&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;Very fun game, more about risk taking than about strategy and tactics. It&#39;s a bit long for the level of randomness, but it makes up for it with tension. I just wish there were more variety of each type of cards, especially horses and goals.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;Had seen young male teenagers playing the game, unwilling to communicate to the waiting girls!  So I thought it MUST be a super game, because who is willing to turn down a talk to girls at that age!!! Later I bought the game and had lots of fun...&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;Okay quik card game. I didn&#39;t have the feeling i was accomplishing anything but i see why a lot of people like it.  Problem might be a weaker player to your right might help you get the win.  I took hard looks and tI left the player to my left behind me. Probably should have played more for myself.  edit: I was thinking of picking this up . but there are plenty of games I would rather play with nong gamers or/and gamers. So the most correct rating would be a 5.  If I decide to pick it up, I&#39;ll up my rating again.  edit: decided to get it as it is such a hit with many and if you want to introduce new people to the hobby this isn&#39;t too bad.&#34;, 5.),
 (&#34;Two plays in and I&#39;m a little concerned that a well-executed temple play is unstoppable.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;Just a great euro.  Play any time.  Easy to teach.  The expansions (if you can find them) are great and change the style of play in very interesting ways. &#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;Even though it&#39;s a bit longer than most games I play, I will almost always play this game.   Love the exploring, managing your economy, and the fighting aspects of this game but my favorite part is probably researching and upgrading your ships. &#34;, 7.),

 (&#39;Take it or leave it&#39;, 5.),
 (&#34;Bought because the box and multi-piece board were very attractive.  I&#39;ve played a solo, a 2-player and a 4-player game, and find the crowded temple in the 4-player game adds a lot of tension.  I prefer it that way.  All the possible actions and the way the novices (meeples) move around the islands, activate and inactivate reminded me of Hansa Teutonica.  The graphic design is excellent!  Setting up the guard path is a pain.  Having helpers to set up this game, one on the path, one on the tokens, gets it started 5 minutes faster.   I fear it will not see play very often as the unusual theme is not an instant hook and as it bears roughly the same difficulty slot in my collection as Hansa Teutonica.  Update: game is still a top-heavy bear to teach but my groups are warming to it.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;another game that was awesome at first but quickly fell off the top games list. Good for playing with friends where you have a playful rivalry of some sort, maybe as a drinking game, but otherwise kind of lame.&#39;, 4.),
 (&#34;Blokus is an abstract strategy game and it&#39;s shame of that. The game is strategic at its core, but refuses to be fun to play.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;I liked this quite a bit. After a few rounds the rules were clear and it was a rather fast-paced tile-laying game with lots of things to consider still. Nice graphics, too. Good game, all in all. &#39;, 8.),

 (&#39;WAR is an old famous board game in Brazil. This version, &#34;Império Romano&#34;, is the best edition, in my opinion. Wonderful art work (for the brazilian average), with cool miniatures. The presence of luck don\&#39;t destroy the game (in my opinion), which can offers hours and hours of joy. I like it very much! &#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;Got this as a gift for my wife mainly because of the theme. It&#39;s a cute, extremely light game. Nothing ground-breaking but a nice short game to wip out if you want something easy.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#34;Easy to break this game - it just needs much more design development. The idea itself isn&#39;t bad...&#34;, 6.),
 (&#34;I like this game I really do, but I have come to accept its flaws - it has a large degree of luck, and the best player is not necessarily the most most likely winner! However it&#39;s a good romp through a good story (how many of us have actually read it - not I sadly), with the theme kind of sticking on okay :)&#34;, 8.),

 (&#39;7-8回プレイしているが、まだレベル１で勝てない。面白いことは面白いが、ソロゲームで一回も勝てないと他の面白さも正しく評価できそうもない。そのため、評価少し辛目。 オニリムにはカードの特殊効果などないことや、拡張ルールがついているのでゲームとしてはオニリムの方が好き。 デッキビルドのシステムは、（ドミニオンよりも）このテーマとあっていると思う。それに、ドミニオンよりもカード枚数少ないから、片付けも楽。それでもPC版があればと思ってしまうが。  何回かトライしてやっとコツがわかって勝てた。だが、他にも勝つルート（こつ？）はあるのだろうか？そう考えると、そのツボを外したら勝てないゲームということで非常につまらないのではないかと思っている。残念なゲームだ。&#39;, 6.),

 (&#34;Even though it has it&#39;s flaws, this is actually a neat game.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;Fabulous game with a unique meld of gaming mechanics.  The only complaint people tend to have about it is the &#34;hiddenness&#34; of scoring.  Phooey.  Do your best, make some small attempts to block other players from doing their best and see what happens.  Fun stuff.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;An interesting take on Magic.  The rules need some work.  I wouldn&#39;t pay full price for it, but I got it for extremely cheap.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;Fun game and it can really make you wonder if the dice hate you or not. Recommend this for families.&#39;, 10.),
 (&#34;Considering I don&#39;t particularly like &#39;double-think&#39; bluffing games, this is short and sweet enough to not offend me.  I wish the pots were different symbols tho!&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;Not as good of a game as many people think. With all of the house rules, you can never be sure what people are playing. It is also incredably easy to cheat by signalling your partner. &#39;, 4.),
 (&#34;Not a perfect rating because it&#39;s too fiddly compared to modern games. But I would have rated it very high if we still were in the 80&#39;s.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;Played a few times&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;The rule is simple, the game system is about half of luck and hand management. I can enjoy what I am thinking about management. Time is just right.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;4/27/10  Puerto Rico is OK, but if I&#39;m playing poorly in a game, I want my farm or space empire to suffer, not have the person on my left win easier.  5/25/10  Very consistent at game night last night... Last place in Puerto Rico and Hansa.  5/25/10  Puerto Rico was better this time. I felt like I started to have a strategy. It might not have been a good strategy, but it was something.  12/9/10  Wow!

 (&#39;Looks great but the gameplay is not for me. Doubt I will visit it again.&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;Nice engine building/worker placement game.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;Became a staple of the group of 20 something I play with. It&#39;s simple, social and produces a lot of laughs - great as a session starter to set up the mood. While being compared to Coup, it&#39;s a different type of beast altogether. It&#39;s unique in hidden role games for not being about elimination, but accumulation of wealth/points (control of game&#39;s lenght) and because roles will constantly shift. It&#39;s not so much about lying as it is about [b]confusion distribution[/b]. The more confusion you sow and lets confused you are, better off you&#39;ll be. Cards flying around, being shuffled, remembered, forgotten, then a couple of players try to block those threatening to win.  The chaos definitely has a Faiduttean signature, but it&#39;s like you&#39;re in control of the volume button (and you want it turned to 11). One of the most laugh inducing games I&#39;ve played and I think I like it more than Coup and Love letter, but needs at least 7 players to work properly. &#34;, 5.),
 (&#39;With Ali Maleki, Ali Davoofar, Saberi, Asani and Ali saeedi Ghani, Farnam, Ardeshiri  Coop version (house rull) very better than orginal rulls.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;I thought I would like this one a bit more than I did. It&#39;s true that it&#39;s very solitaire-ish, but there is a little bit of hate-drafting going on. Unfortunately, there are also so few tiles that it&#39;s difficult to keep someone from ever getting one type. I feel like going for roads and parks is the way to win, as schools usually aren&#39;t worth the hassle, and sidewalks only score you a maximum of 20 points. In many ways, this just felt like an inferior version of Patchwork, with a much fiddlier setup. I thought this game was fine for what it was, but ultimately not something I felt like I needed to play again.&#34;, 5.),
 (&#39;Finally got to play this at Unity Games XV. I enjoy dexterity games, and this one is quick, easy to learn, hectic and lots of fun. This will probably always come with me whenever I go to any big game day.  There is little strategy to this game, but it is very silly and usually results in much laughter and cramped wrists.&#39;, 7.),

 (&#39;Way too long and too hard. Better if played in teams but quiz games is really not my bag.&#39;, 3.),
 (&#34;I&#39;d rather play the previous edition. I suppose this one is easier to setup and a little less fiddly, but it falls short where it matters.  The game sacrifices playability for story. It used to be easy to decide what to do with stockpiled resources. Too many gate tokens? Go to the church and get blessed. Too much money? Go to the store and buy something. Too many items? Give them to another player? With encounters-only, players have way less control. I guess it tells a good story, but it isn&#39;t a good game to play.&#34;, 4.),
 (&#39;Classic Set Collector Game.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;A fascinating game design, basically similar to Mice and Mystics but based on a storybook with constantly changing pages and special rules.  Bit of an oddball, because the theme is squarely aimed at children but the game system is aimed at adults. Starting off the Storybook System with a safer theme might have been wise -- aside from the name, there&#39;s nothing that makes the game system inherently child-oriented.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#34;Even though I&#39;m awful at it, I love this game!  The theme is great and you can tell the designers really did their homework.  &#34;, 10.),

 (&#39;22x16x3&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;I agree that it is not a game for everybody - but if you are into this kind of game this one is brilliant.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;First impression (5 players): The game has a nice basic idea. You form a pie and you must divide pie and then everyone gets to pick a slice (with divider being last to pick). You can either eat pie pieces immediately or leave them wait for later to possibly gain more points. It&#39;s an okeyish filler but definitely shouldn&#39;t be played with 5 players. There you have too little room to maneuver with slicing.&#34;, 5.),
 (&#39;2-4P&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;I am excited. Our group has played the prologue and it made us want more. Can&#39;t wait to actually start the first game.  Edit. Now we have played 5 games all together and the game is still interesting. I love how the story evolves. But in our group one player is dominating the game with points. I don&#39;t think others can catch him anymore. Still I do want to finish the game. Legacy games are best when a group is playing against the game and not against each other.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#34;It&#39;s much better than clue. Luck may be important in a three player game, and a good notation system is especially necessary in a 7 player game.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#34;What everyone else here has said about this game is true. I don&#39;t feel like I have anything more to add.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;I was looking for a game that would give &#34;adult me&#34; what Hero Quest gave &#34;child me&#34;, but Descent was absolutely not it. My expectations might have been unrealistic, but the game did not feel like an adventure, rather a chore, some math and calculations, distance measurement and hammering at the nail with a potato.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;This hasn&#39;t been the hit for us that we hoped given all the excitement about how it changed the world of games.  I know that the die rolling doesn&#39;t play the same role as it does in Monopoly and that it&#39;s all about playing the odds, but it can be seriously irritating when a 6 just never comes up, you can&#39;t get bricks (or whatever) and noone will trade them for you because they know you want them.  Might work better for us when the kids are older, so still prepared for it to surprise me...&#34;, 5.),
 (&#39;Avg. Game Weight: 1.5 Bought in June 09&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Designer: Vital Lacerda  Awesome game. Heavy, but not too much. About the same weight as Caylus, but better.   Long-term Keeper: Yes—-Why? One of my favorite heavy games. Love the art. Wine...&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;After 2+ Plays: Quite fun.  Some shades of Suburbia, but really a completely different game.  The &#34;pay the auction-master&#34; mechanic is here transferred to a fixed-price system, and it really works very well.  There\&#39;s a lot of luck, but not too much given its short playtime.  Rating could easily rise a point with future play. &#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;The layout of the squares on most versions make it difficult to keep track of which direction your pawn should be moving.  This makes it harder for young kids play without help.  Monte Rolla is a MUCH better version of this roll/spin and move classic.&#39;, 2.),
 (&#39;Love this game. SO many choices and things to do. Beautiful art. Great worker placement. Fun take that mechanisms as well.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;prototype for playtesting&#39;, 10.),
 (&#39;Enjoyable auction game. I prefer High Society, but this is also very good.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Everything I thought it would be and more. Fast to learn, easy set up, plays fast. Maybe not as &#34;deep&#34; as its younger sibling (Ashes) but still a modern classic.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;This game was a pocket game that came in a copy of Strategy and Tactics magazine, July-August 1985.  I played this a few times solitaire, and it was interesting to play; the rules weren&#39;t overly complex and the play flowed fairly well.  Would have liked to play this with a player at some point.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#34;Definitely fun -- but we must be playing SOMETHING wrong as we never can get the option cards.  Still, we laugh a lot and usually at me since I don&#39;t have the spatial reasoning necessary to plan this well. My bot is always spinning in a corner somewhere.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;Quick, thoughtful, and enjoyable.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Hey.... Stratego with Lord of the Rings theme pasted on.  Nothing to see here.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Tried twice now. Seems better with 4 players than with 5. Second game with 4 was a very good experience. There is a little too much time spent in money handling. I like atmosphere and &#34;evolution&#34; that happens in game. Definately willing to play if I have 3++ hours for it. If only it would be a little shorter...&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;2012-06-13  Initial Rating: 8.5 (May 2012)  What a surprise! When I played Indonesia I didn`t expect to find this jewel of a game. If you like economic games this is a must!  It is a little heavy but it is a game I want to play again. In particular the mergers require basic math that can push away some gamers but the game is meaty enough for me to bypass that. As with Antiquity, this game can be very unforgiving, if you do wrong choices at the beginning of the game you are, effectively, out of the game, which is a plus for me :D.   It seems it has different viable paths to victory but I have to play more to verify this.  The game is marvelous, however for an expensive game like this I found the errors on the game board to be unforgivable (there are 3 print errors on the map as well as on some cards). The Indonesia map is pretty but it doesn’t help the gameplay in any way, also the rulebook is confusing at times (but the rules are relatively simple).  In conclusion, Indonesia is a great gamer´s game, fit for only hardcore gamers due to its heaviness and time factor. A must have for me.  Current Rating: 8.5 [hr] 2012-06-25  With a second play I ratify this is a great game, the rating just went up to a 9 and perhaps it will go higher. Also I´m not so sure the game is as unforgiving as I thought, but I still feel it is unforgiving enough for me. It seems if you made bad decisions at the start is hard to recover but not impossible.  Current Rating: 9.0 [hr] 2014-11-18  It’s been hard to get Indonesia to the table, but I managed to sneak another play :D. Nowadays I’m much more harsher with my ratings, but I still feel Indonesia is a good game.  I will buy it in the future and I´m usually willing to play it, so it is a 7.0 for me. I’m updating the rating.  Current Rating: 7.0  [b]Jgoyes´ Awards: [/b]  [imageid=3132796inline][imageid=3132799inline]&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;Heavy theme and variety keeps me coming back to this game at parties. Fun for those days when you don&#39;t feel like solving partial differential equations to play your turn (I&#39;m looking at you, Euro-games).&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;I don\&#39;t usually like hidden role games like Werewolf or Resistance, but I\&#39;ll give this one a relatively high rating because it can play fast even with a large group.  My biggest complaint is that at least half of the games I played devolved into a &#34;Princess Bride&#34; situation where on the last round the red team controlled one room with the bomber and the blue team controlled the other room with the president.  Then the blue team wins of neither team or both teams send the bomber/president, but the red team wins if only one team sends the bomber/president.  I also didn\&#39;t like how you could get trapped in the minority of a room and be stuck there the whole game with nothing to do.  These complaints were based on games with around 10 people, so I\&#39;m hoping these issues decrease as you add more people.&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;fantastic game better than poker&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;I really enjoy the strategy round mechanism, as well as the incorporation of the political and religious features. Unfortunately, teaching new players can be lengthy and the subject and process is daunting enough for new players that it rarely hits the table.    &#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;It&#39;s really just a step past dots and boxes, but it has a few unexpected subtleties.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;Bom Jogo&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Cheeky game which keeps excitement as game course can change surprisingly all the time.  The idea of this game is nicely developed and suitable for experienced card players as well as for beginners who are interested in local particularities.  Due to numerous variations it keeps challenging even when the group of other players changes.  Despite I am critical with card games we all enjoyed playing.&#39;, 10.),
 (&#39;Добротная евроигра. &#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Good dexterity game. Very quick - perhaps a bit too quick to get a 7.&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;Pretty jenga!&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;Played twice. Both times the first hour was enjoyable and fast moving. Both times the last half-hour saw the game grind to a halt as we struggled to meet end-game conditions. Shame - probably can be fixed quite easily with a house rule of some kind though. &#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;First edition, but with some 2nd ed upgraded components (full-colour fuel tracks)&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;I liked A Few Acres of Snow and this (overall) felt like an upgrade, but I had concerns over whether it is too easy for the Carthaginians to rush the end of the game through developing cities and the system for land battles was too slow for my taste.  Ultimately decided to sell it and move on.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;I had fun in my only playing, it certainly feels thematic and there is a bit more strategy than is otherwise readily apparent.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Very nice, thinky 2 player card game. Very tense, and with a different feel than other card games. Much of my gaming is now shorter 2 player games with my younger daughter, so I’m considering adding this to the collection &#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;20+ plays / 2,3,4 players  LIKE: Quick, very fun and competitive. Feels like a stock game more than an auction game. Love the partial-knowledge mechanism. Deeper game than it looks. The two halves of the game (gifting phase, auction phase) is unique, which keeps this game fresh.  DISLIKE: Some randomness, so sometimes draws can be poor. Sometimes you can&#39;t tell what someone has. Theme is thin as paper.  OVERALL: It&#39;s a great game in a small package. Combines the stock feel with push-your luck and a bit of auction. Card counting is recommended, but not imperative. So many ways to trick people so you can slyly grab a different category majority. Great with 3 players, since you can try to get the other two players to compete for a category you don&#39;t want.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;Quick dice drafting game. yahtzee with a twist. Good for 30 minute play max.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;A game that appeals to a broad range of players, beyond the core &#39;geeks&#39;. Partly because it is so visual with its large, attractive board.&#34;, 9.),
 (&#34;This one will probably only go up for me. It first off fixes the things I hate about blood rage(the card draft, the board layout, and pacing). I also really like how the gods feel different and combine that with the upgrade system and the different scoring tiles there&#39;s a bunch of replayability with this one.   I will also say that I was a little worried about having the board cleared every era until I realized that is what make the glyphs so important because they stay on the board and also the fact that there&#39;s quite a few ways to score points makes the game have many interesting decisions that you can make.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;After one game with the kids I really like this game.  I think it could be used to teach adults how to play Catan too.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;I played this again at Origins 2008 and found that, even though I was away from the game for more than 20 years, it still played well, was a lot of fun and quite manageable.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;1 Play  Really satisfying engine builder imo.  10/14/19 Needs further evaluation.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;[b]Impressions after 1 play:[/b] It&#39;s a good game, luckless, in which you try to build plantations and other buildings in order to gather as many VPs as possible. What I like about it: - that you cannot trade the same goods as before (at least until the trading house is emptied) - that you must fill the boats in order to ship the goods, which creates some nice strategies What I didn&#39;t like: - it&#39;s bland....let&#39;s say tasteless... although much better and more complex than San Juan, I still prefer RftG&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;I like tile placement games becasue the randomness of the board makes games different and one has to &#34;think on one\&#39;s feet&#34;.  It does bring with it though the problem of &#34;luck of the tile draw&#34; and the analysis paralysis problems of some people (so I will watch who I am prepared to play this with).  It is supposed to be 45 mins of fun (and is with the right people) but with the wrong people can easily become 90 mins of purgatory, hence my medium rating. &#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;excellent jeu aux méchanismes qui changent beaucoup de l&#39;ordinaire mais qui sont bien prenants. mais par contre le matériel à vraiment quelque problème (pas de noms de rivières, cartes parfois mal traduites, regles imprécises...) ce qui gache un peu. c&#39;est pas grand chose mais c&#39;est dommage. ceci dit le jeu en vaut largement la chandelle&#34;, 7.),
 (&#34;It&#39;s pandemic. Pretty easy game. This is a great introductory game for people who are not boardgamers.&#34;, 9.),
 (&#34;Classic game of Strategy.  This is a game all about efficiently taki9ng control of territory and contesting enemy advances.  It&#39;s one of the oldest games of strategy of all time, along with Chess and Macala, and should be saluted for being one of the first, as well as one of the best.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;One of my fave games. [Santa Grogs 2014]&#39;, 10.),
 (&#34;It&#39;s a slightly more adult version of Telestrations. It&#39;s good, but it&#39;s there to mainly cater to the Cards Against Humanity crowd. Playing with the right people can make this edition a blast.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;Pretty standard zombie game. but I enjoyed my first play.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Nice art, Catan for two meets explorations.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;I don&#39;t like Chess. I&#39;m not calling it &#39;bad&#39; (3), but I am placing it as a below average gaming experience for me. I think that chess tricks you into believing it&#39;s a fun tactical game with variable piece powers, when it&#39;s really an in depth game of analysis and prediction of a very limited set of options. Not really fun at all for me at that level.&#34;, 4.),
 (&#39;Breezy, two player trading game. There is some light strategy, and a &#34;push your luck&#34; element that can provide some nice tension.  Traded for Race for the Galaxy&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Not that bad actually - might be better with expansions? But I like more for example Babel -kind of streamlined struggles.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Very enjoyable! I quite like this game.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;Drab map, drab counters, drab box, but a great game in it&#39;s time!  If you can get past the ugliness of Tobruk&#39;s presentation (not much eye candy here), you&#39;ll find a great game.  Tobruk is tactical, tank-to-tank combat in North Africa 1941.  While this one&#39;s out of print, its successor, Advanced Tobruk by Critical Hit is available and thriving.&#34;, 6.),

 (&#39;Great for its simplicity and fun theme.  Still hits the table.  One of my first euros.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;Not really convinced about FFG&#39;s Silver Line. Do I really want to pay $20 for a series of ultra-light, disposable games when for an extra few bucks I can buy something far meatier? I enjoyed this one (and got it for a good price), perhaps because it is Knizia. Light, but I enjoyed the level of guess-timiation required to win. Just quick enough not to get tiresome, as there isn&#39;t a whole lot to it. Incredibly inelegant scoring system though, with loads of adding and multiplying - far too much for such a lite game.   &#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;A fairly by-the-numbers miniatures game.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;(1 play) Only played it once, but it was amazing.  The gameplay was great once we got a round or two in, and I can see that it will be very replayable.  This game has the most incredible art I have seen on a game.  A heavy game for a brutal romp through Hell.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Not very impressed. Cool miniatures (very few of them and this cause very often an event) but the game is not so cool. I played only few hours.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Good gateway game. The poker chips make the game. &#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;It&#39;s an okay puzzler, but I still prefer Blokus, which is easier, and more streamlined.&#34;, 5.),
 (&#39;Need to play it more but the game is gorgeous and all of the pieces make for a lot of fun.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;I enjoy the push your luck aspect of this game, but sometimes it is almost impossible to catch up if you have had a bad round. I like that you have to strategize what you get rid of because your opponent can always pick it up later, as there are 5 separate discard piles. &#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Designers: Matt Leacock and Chuck Yager  What a HUGE disappointment! This is Pandemic-lite and NOT in a good way. Decisions are obvious and dull. I couldn’t imagine being any more disappointed by what looked like a really cool game. &#39;, 4.),
 (&#39;This game is brilliant. I spent around 3 hours playing it for Charity on tabletop day. My only problem with it is the setup time. It takes about half an hour which sometimes is way too long.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;Nice counters and map.  The Balck Sea Black Death system has certain charm in its complexity.  But it is not to everyone&#39;s taste either.  Jack Radey utilised much of his research efforts in the former Soviet materials.  A remarkable work, if not lacking all the GMT colors that the customers get used to and spoiled at.  &#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;ENFUNDADO&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Danger Circuit board, Civilized and Luck Promo Cards, are all included in the base box.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;A wonderful tile placement game from Renier Knizia. The components are top notch, from the puzzle piece boards to the hex tiles and the plastic figurines. The only downsides are that the boards are a bit on the thin side and the &#39;1&#39;, stylized to look like Sinic character writing like many things set in East Asia, looks like a &#39;7&#39;, which can be confusing to new players.  The game play is very simple and surprisingly fast. Lay all the figurines on to the cities, with no two same types of figures on the same city, one at a time in turn order. Afterwards, just place a tile, take another turn if it has a kanji on it, then refresh to five tiles. If a city is completely surrounded by land tiles, the players with the most powerful tiles (indicated by the number on the tile) wins the figurine. As I said, it&#39;s very easy to explain and quick to play, although that is adjustable depending on how AP-tolerant players are (that a plus and minus, if the players agree on not).   The biggest problem is with end game victory conditions. It&#39;s not that hard, but it&#39;s still on the wonky side. It&#39;s bit like Lost Cities in that way. It&#39;s best when explaining the game, to put this first and foremost. Definitely worth getting.&#34;, 10.),
 (&#34;A fast, light strategy game.  It&#39;s nice filler and easy to teach to new people because the rules are so simple.  The theme of penguins and fish is also a hit with my crowd. &#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;This is the best Legacy game I have played. The campaign from start to finish is really cohesive and the mechanics evolve very naturally in a way that never overwhelms you with new things. The character progression is very nice and the way the board evolves over time really feels meaningful. I have played this completely through twice now and I can see myself playing it another time or two again.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;Cute for family stuff, once in a year.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Makes for a lovely drinking game if you write rules on certain pieces&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;I bought this largely because without it there\&#39;d be a gap in my set of Alea boxes. That is to say, I wasn\&#39;t really sold on the description alone. The game is very simple to play, and I was skeptical that it would be anything other than a random dice-fest... but I was wrong.  Sure, there\&#39;s a bunch of luck involved in Las Vegas, but the strategy comes from finding the right balance between risk and reward. Occasionally you\&#39;ll have a turn where there\&#39;s an obviously &#34;correct&#34; move, but most of the time you are faced with a number of tough choices, and there\&#39;s not necessarily a right or wrong move.  Play is reasonably quick, but I genuinely think there is more depth here than in a lot of the sorts of games that often get slapped with the &#34;filler&#34; label.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Got this to avoid overplaying Carcassonne and it worked. It\&#39;s a hit in my gaming group. We get the feeling of playing a &#34;real&#34; game in about 8 minutes per player.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Great party game, easy to learn, easy to teach, and I have a lot of fun every time I play it with my friends or families. The guessing is just fun, trying to come up with clues that match up is fun. One of the best party games out there.&#39;, 9.),

 (&#39;每個故事的開始，都是從前從前的遙遠年代，有著充滿可能的故事腳色發展與結局，過程中常常是樂趣不斷的奇思妙想或荒謬的自圓其說，輸贏結果還不能自己說了算，必須看大家的想法，是個訓練溝通、表達和聯想力的好遊戲&#39;, 9.),

 (&#39;Very simple monster game, with manageable counter density (although the introductory Arnhem scenario is very crowded)!&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;There are a couple of cards that were interesting, but it was a far lesser game than the original.  I may keep the game just to swap those in once in a while to mix things up.  However, playing it on its own is not something I think will happen again.&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;Forgettable game.  I remember it being a little to tough and arbitrary to do things that seemed like the core of the game (make a recipe).&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;First play was &#34;ok&#34; but didn\&#39;t really grab my attention.  Will definitely need to play again to assess how I feel about it. &#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;wonderful components and a unique logic-puzzle mechanism that&#39;s lots of fun for me&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;This is fun. One of the few games the wife accepts to play. Somehow I always get the lucky draws and win. Have to lose sometimes not to lose the opponent.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;played: 5+&#39;, 9.),
 (&#34;Not the greatest game but always gets pulled out as it is a great game to bring out for new player&#39;s to games. Has a little of everything and is not complicated. If it was not for it&#39;s ease and replay I am not sure it would be played much. Eh, I would still like it.  Overall Score 7, Appearence 7, Components 7, The Box (storage) 6, Rulebook 7, Ease of Play 8, Mechanics 8, Involvment 7, Replayability 8, Uniqueness 7, Luck 6 v Strategy 4 (The higher the number the more it leans that way.)&#34;, 8.),

 (&#39;its easy . usually easy games  not for me  i know it when i played digital version . but board game version has a magic in it ,,i dont know how but somehow i like it and never bore when i play it .&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Differs from pax first edition with the completely different victory condition. This time it’s about vps. The rule book is a vast improvement from it’s predecessor, but it is still not for everyone. It’s a tableau building brain burner. Paxes are tough to teach, but it’s well worth the effort to learn them. Paxes are one of a kind games.&#39;, 10.),
 (&#39;A good game, but not &#34;amazing&#34;. the biggest issue is the tribe cards. The tribe card design is very bad. You can not see the effect of a tribe card easily (is it ongoing? is it onetime? is it at the end of the game type of cards?)and also it\&#39;s very easy to miss an effect in your tableau.   &#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;Wonderful 2010 Secret Santa gift! Amazingly fun race game, with unusual theme and well designed mechanics. On thing i love is that the winner is not the first to reach the finish line, but the one to cross it faster! Unlike many other race games, being last the whole time doesn&#39;t mean you are bound to loose.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;This was the first Euro game I was introduced to and I was hooked on the first play.  While I play it less frequently now as new games are brought into the mix I still look forward to playing this game&#39;, 7.),

 (&#39;Fun and quick little double-guessing game.  Engaging and well-designed, but unclear staying power.    Desperately needs reference cards.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Great gameplay - even plays good as solitaire version!  Fun theme and solid mechanics. &#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Great game; downgraded for replay value&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;Wonderfully tense economic game with difficult (yet mechanically simple enough) decisions. The different characters and the associated turn order give the game a lot of spice. This game is a bit longer than what I usually like to play, but it didn&#39;t feel long as it was very engaging.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#34;Fun push your luck game.  People say it&#39;s best with 2 but to me it scaled well to 4 and even 5.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#34;Quick and easy filler. The main advantage is that it doesn&#39;t last long, so it really doesn&#39;t get boring. The game is heavily dependent on luck and there is no strategy in it.  Greitas ir lengvas žaidimas. Pagrindinis jo privalumas tas, kad jis netrunka per ilgai ir todėl neatsibosta. Žaidimas smarkiai priklausomas nuo sėkmės ir jame praktiškai nėra strategijos.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;I like to play this game with my kids.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Despite the somewhat wonky (but simple) terrain rules, a couple of odd unit selections and powers, and the unfortunate misprints on the Combat Results Table (see my corrected version in the images section) &#34;Viking Gods&#34; is clever, streamlined, and fun. The best of the TSR minigames! Hail Odin!&#39;, 8.),

 (&#39;Another amazing game that I just overplayed.  I probably just need expansions, as too many of the same card combinations have come up.  I got a good 30-50 plays out of it so far, however.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Fun game that kids can enjoy.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Great classic game. Truly shines with Advanced Civilization.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Good Risk like game, and one of the few that is better. Remember never to let the orcs win.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;An okay filler game. It Bang! streamlined, but it also loses part of it&#39;s appeal. It&#39;s better, but it&#39;s also easier to see the lack of any strategy. &#34;, 6.),
 (&#34;Other people have said that this game reminds them of a lighter Caylus. I agree, but just because it&#39;s lighter doesn&#39;t mean that it lacks in meaningful decisions. There are still a ton of ways to propel your strategy forward and work against your opponents, and like in many euro&#39;s there is a fine line between managing your money and your victory points. With more plays, I could see this game playing in 60-90 minutes with my group, which is GREAT for the type of game it is!&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;Best game of EagleGames, best played with the standard rules and some of the Advanced ones, like the cards and the new types of units.&#39;, 10.),
 (&#39;Mutiny on the high seas! After playing with 4 players, I can say that this is a fun, tense card game of second/out guessing your rival  merchants with whom you will sometimes be cooperating to hold a mutiny on board your vessel and overthrow the ship’s current captain.   It’s certainly a neat small-box card game with a sort-of dense ruleset that is somewhat difficult to explain easily and quickly. We eventually opted to play a practice round to feel out the various game phases-etc, and we just went on playing from there.  I imagine increased plays with familiar players would see some particular patterns and expectations emerge via the “groupthinking hive mind” or whatever.  Cool game.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;Interesting cube-bag building game.  Downtime seemed a big problem - even though players draw 3 cubes at the end of their turn and can plan their next turn, because there are so many ways to draw more cubes during your turn and because as the number of cubes decreases in your bag you can try to plan out what colors you will draw next turn (or if you should use tech to add more cubes to your bag), AP was an issue for us, especially me. I really don&#39;t like the aspect that you can have a wasted turn when you only draw 1 last cube from your bag - it meant I spent an excessive amount of time counting and planning out 2-3 turns in advance to avoid this potential but this aspect didn&#39;t feel fun, just work.  The actual gameplay on the board - moving figures on hexes, occupying cities/ruins for extra actions, extremely simple battles - felt very uninspired and cookie-cutter.  Although quite different, the game reminded me a bit of Macao, where you&#39;re deciding what color cubes to collect and planning for the future.  So all in all, I&#39;d be happy to play this one again, but I&#39;m not going to seek it out and would much prefer Macao.    Also, good lighting is a must. I&#39;m not color-blind at all, but for me, the red and purple cubes and their spots on cards were sometimes near-impossible for me to tell apart and I needed other players to tell me the color.  Really bad design choice there.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;This is a push your luck set collecting game. You travel deeper and deeper into the cave collecting various items or accomplishments. The game never felt exciting despite a theme of cave exploration and the ending was anti climatic. For example in Ticket to Ride you can step back and admire the route you built, but here if completed one of the point scoring objects of taking a picture of an interesting cave feature all you got was a token. One thing I did like was the cave is create by laying out tiles, so each time it will be different.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;As cooperative games go, this one is pretty fun.  It really feels like a race against time to quell the disease faster than it&#39;s spreading.  If you&#39;re a fan of cooperatives, this one is sure to please (though it does have the one-player-dictates-to-everyone-else issue).  For me though, cooperative isn&#39;t my favorite style of play.  (5+ plays)&#34;, 6.),

 (&#39;Unique system, very innovative.  Has a couple of vague rules, but quite playable and different.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;This is a fun, quick, 2-player puzzle.    If you like 2-player abstracts at all, you will probably want to play this again immediately after each game you complete.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;THE Civ game. It&#39;s a longer game than I normally play, but it never really feels like a slog. I do wish there were multiple win conditions other than just culture.&#34;, 9.),

 (&#34;First played June 20th, 2007.  This is a quick learn (5min), however for what it was, it took too long in a 4 player game (90min).  You will need to play it once before you know what strategy to do.  I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d recommend this as a game play.  It seems to be more of a filler game and it takes too long for that.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#34;Mostly it turns into some kind of &#39;trench war&#39; :(&#34;, 5.),
 (&#39;Plays okay with 2 or 4 but was made for 3 player.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;Only played once and it was kind of boring. You don&#39;t have many possibilites to play your tiles. And if you don&#39;t have the luck to draw the right one, you might even lose a turn where you have to change your tiles. So, too less decisions and too much luck for my taste.&#34;, 4.),
 (&#39;Tiny auction and tile placing game with beautiful components.Much better than zooleretto regarding zoofeeling and gamefun.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;The most beautiful cardboard components. It&amp;#039;s a gem of a game, too. Get one for yourself, and a couple for friends/relations.&#39;, 10.),
 (&#39;http://www.ronkkonen.com/boardgames.html#Morgenland&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;Takes the idea of a roll and move game, but on a larger scale.  Rather than moving one or two spaces, you&#39;ll be going upwards of thirty.  Luckily, this movement is controlled, which I rather appreciate.  A nice gateway to racing genre.&#34;, 5.),
 (&#34;Solid co-op, but the mechanisms don&#39;t differ from the original enough for me.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#34;Cute, and surprisingly complete for such a small PnP. I&#39;m usually good with difficult and/or random games that are short, and I like difficult solos, but this one combines length, randomness, and difficulty (AFAICT: I lost my first two games) with a light weight that doesn&#39;t compel me to keep playing.&#34;, 5.),
 (&#39;Horrible rulebook with almost 50 pages, it has got so many tokens and cards and symbols and triggerwords and I simply cannot believe there is no summary for all the symbols and none for all the triggerwords!?   You have to look up each single one multiple times, because there are so many and you have to look them up in special situations again. And often they cannot be found where you would think they should be. We took around 8 hours just for the prologue (!!!???) And we are not new to the boardgaming hobby. I\&#39;ve been playing tons of different games, also games like descent etc. But this one is so bloated it is insane.  AFTER you finally have some idea of whats going on and how to handle all the different rules it gets a bit better flow-wise. But still it is hard to remember to always pick an enemy activation card after each hero and not after each round, and also remember to leave the event cards in play for 2 complete rounds and not only for 1. You have to keep track for a lot of things, that\&#39;s book-keeping and not what I think of as being fun.  The miniatures are great, the art is decent and the storybook is written immersive and exciting. But I wouldn\&#39;t put this game anywhere near the term &#34;fun&#34; for me at least, it is not streamlined very well and the rules are exhausting.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;For a game about Vikings fighting there is too easy to win by not fighting or losing, lost interest everytime I&#39;ve played (20+ now). Wished there was less emphasis on Loki and sacrificing.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#34;Extremely hard; Couldn&#39;t finish game, very disappointing&#34;, 6.),
 (&#34;*1-5 Players  So much thinking, yet, it&#39;s a very fun, enjoyable experience.  At the end seeing how your plan executed is a joy.  This will probably be one of my best games of all time.&#34;, 10.),
 (&#39;Provisional rating, one play. I like co-op games, but I like them to tell a story, and to involve a wider range of actions and decisions than did Clacks. We chose difficult mode, but it was still too easy.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;I really liked, and enjoyed, the theme in this game!  You really do feel like a merchant, or a pirate (if you choose), when playing this game. The realism comes from playing the rumour, mission, and glory cards.  It is fun to try to fulfill a mission, or venture to see whether a rumour is true (Am I lucky enough to roll the influence I need?).  There is a certain push your luck portion to this game (Do I roll the dice to attack one more time? Do I dare pick up another cargo card in a merchant raid? Do I have enough to be successful?). This level of tension, the cool map, and awesome models, make this game fun and worth its adventure.  On the negative side, this game feels like there is a little too much luck (ex. dice rolling, random enemy ship placement, etc.) and the game is just way too long (It took me over 4 hours to play it).  The rules are not the easiest to learn; there are a lot of rules - and combat felt somewhat convoluted.    On the positive, the game feels fun and I want to play it again! Sadly, I am not sure when I will ever get it back to the table (especially with more than 2 players).&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;やることは我慢大会なので爽快感はないが、じりじりと濃密な戦いが楽しめる。 最初は特殊カードを入れず、数とのにらめっこに疲れたら特殊カードを導入すると良い。  後攻が有利なので二戦やって合計ポイントで競うと良い。でも、一試合やったら疲れる。&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;Classic children&#39;s game. The version I have has uneven bricks which makes it easy to get some pieces and impossible to get other pieces. It&#39;s from gallery play named &#39;Vallende toren&#39;. If you want Jenga, I would advise to get the original.&#34;, 5.),
 (&#34;Every Swedish child of my generation played Carrom in school. It&#39;s a fun game.&#34;, 4.),
 (&#34;Board games that preach an FPS experience never really hold up to their promises, at least they didn&#39;t until Adrenaline! It does give you a nice FPS sensation combined with a good tabletop experience. In its niche genre it&#39;s definitely one of the best.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;RK 板塊拼放、區域控制、手牌管理&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;Althought it&#39;s a very little expansion, it completes the map for WW2. Very interesting the Spanish civil war&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;Complex, beutifull, fun and made by gamers. What else do you need?&#39;, 10.),
 (&#39;I have a copy called &#34;The Dictionary Game&#34;. &#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Diplomacy variant.  Static set-up still annoys me.  The exceptions added to make it different from Diplomacy are fiddly extras that change the game marginally.&#39;, 3.),
 (&#39;Serves a single purpose. Does well in that situation, but is very group dependent. Fun to play occasionally.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;My only complaint is that there isn&#39;t much teamwork and player interaction required. Everyone ends up taking their own turn and having their own adventure. The components and setting are great, but it might as well be a solo game.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;Good party game but Wits and Wagers is so much better.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;It&#39;s like cooperative Pit, only that would be too easy, so everyone is assigned a psychosis to make things inconvenient.  I mean, it&#39;s a silly game.  And it&#39;s silly.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#34;This is a nice party game, easy to pick up and a nice filler after a long game - or just to kick things off. Basically it&#39;s dump on every one else as quickly as you can without being dumped on yourself so that you are the last person to hit the deck.  Because it is real time and the dealer can speed up the pace of the game - this can get quite manic!&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;Hilarious! and also a covert backdoor double secret way to get non RPG gamers at the table and ROFLing before they know you cleared off the dinner dishes! Actually it gets non &#34;gamers&#34; (tabletop) to the table in a similar fashion, hence the double entendre at the top!   More than the two plays listed, but such good fun.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Excellent game for the family, though works best with exactly four players.&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;The theme is horrifically treated - the players genocide native peoples who are literally erased and not depicted anywhere other than a &#34;strength&#34; icon to be killed, and their possessions &#34;plundered&#34; (the game\&#39;s description, not mine). Native territories are depicted as empty except for trade goods and ready for Europeans to occupy. This is the first board game that I\&#39;ve really thought was racist.  The game itself is OKish but can\&#39;t overcome the above burden. Gameplay is very opaque - I was usually left feeling unsure of what to do or why my decisions mattered. Frustration index was medium and satisfaction index medium as well. Picking a nation to play, and bidding on what order to pick, was far too confusing for a new player. There was excitement in the last several turns and the overall duration was just right.&#39;, 3.),
 (&#39;Very interesting. A good game to do simulation and to bring to the table from time to time&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Nice game.  Thick, without being too meaty for me.  Mmm.. now I&amp;#039;m hungry.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;A more complex game of Risk with a Game Of Thrones theme.  And it takes FOREVER to play.&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;Box #15&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;As with all Eagle Gryphon games, this one&#39;s got top-notch components - cute touch with the easels.  I do like Fresco better in the way the game flows, though.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;nice real time dice rolling coop&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Very good. Been wanting to play this for years. It very cleverly manages to pull off the feat of sticking to the feel of th ebook, working within the confines of the geography and actually still being a good game. Also some unique elements like supply enabled you to stretch out quite easily, but still find it hard to increase your effective armies. Would happily play again, &#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Fun&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;Basically a dungeon crawler. Not what I expected. &#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;This game takes pandemic in a whole new direction while still keeping true to the essence of pandemic.  Every month my group wants to know what comes next, what new mechanics/story developments will happen.    The game is filled with self-balancing mechanics (funding/upgrades) to keep the game at just the right level of difficulty for each play group; although I would still recommend most of the players play normal pandemic.  I have to say, the first time I had to place a sticker, my heart wrenched.  And then the first time I read, &#34;Destroy this card&#34;...  I had to think long and hard.  Now we spend a great deal of time trying to think of clever new ways to destroy each card.  So far: tearing, burning, shredding, eating, and soaking.&#39;, 10.),
 (&#39;An area control game, some interesting decisions. Luck plays a major role. Figures can be difficult to distinguish, easily damaged.   Brother might like? Worth buying on the cheap.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;Most of the games on my list, if I rag on one aspect, it&#39;s luck. This game is pretty much all about luck, everything changes from turn to turn. The only way to do any sort of strategy is by using effectively a card that lets you play multiple cards and having a good hand draw selection. It happens fairly frequently, and most games seem to be won this way, but theme and speed of play just make this enjoyable for me, and it&#39;s anybody&#39;s game at any point whatsoever. So yeah, this is probably the only time I&#39;d cheerfully play a game that has such a strong luck aspect.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;I can see the cleverness of the turn order mechanism, but this is too much of an open information and connection game for me. Also, a game that is all about passing quickly loses interest for me, though the game is short. Our second game was five-player with lots of pointless lakes, and that didn´t make the game better imo. Components are uninspiring. All in all, not a game I would ask to play again but I wouldn´t refuse it.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Easy to teach. Excellente family game.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Really fun to play with the kids... &#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;Nice game with somewhat unique mechanisms. It&#39;s a mix of strategy and tactics, while good play should tend towards more tactical play. Just don&#39;t put your ships on a third space all the time, even if that may fit your strategy best. Go for faster play and hence, more influence.  Keep in mind that the game can end quickly, so watch your opponents!&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;Fun and exciting, although just a teeny bit too long to make it to the table very often. Good atmosphere and great production. Becomes a bit repetitive after a while, perhaps.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Fun little game.  Works well with my family.  Works better with more players.  Probably replaced by Space Base, though.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;Really enjoyed playing this as a 2 player.  I imagine I&#39;d like it even more with 3 or 4.  Definitely want to play this again.  Definitely a solid euro with all player counts. &#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;One of the best deduction games I have ever played.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;Sure it&#39;s too complicated.  They should give out a medal to anyone who can understand the landing craft rules.  But it is also a great game.  Go for it.&#34;, 10.),
 (&#39;Another light fun game with a great deduction mechanic.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;The tension created by the infection deck is unparalleled in gaming. As long as someone doesn&#39;t try to QB the whole game, this is one of the best co-op games ever.&#34;, 9.),
 (&#39;I played this with our group one night and enjoyed it and decided to get a copy to play with my family.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;Quite variable new area majority game.  It has some hand management and some engine-building, but it doesn&#39;t really excel at either.  I didn&#39;t get much of a feeling that turn 12 was that much different than turn 1.  That being said, I had a good time solving mini hand management puzzles.  Hated the iconography learning curve, though...ouch.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;I rate games according to how much children enjoy them and how much I enjoy playing with them.    Even my 2 1/2-year-old granddaughter can play this game – like apples to apples, she can choose a card and maybe win. However, even the 2 1/2 year-old knew more about Disney characters, than I.   I enjoy more, the version of this game called colors, where the subject matter  is general info.,  but unfortunately, not as interesting to children.&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;Tableau building  Which of the Doctor\&#39;s auctions do you choose?  &#34;Masterpiece of emergent design&#34; Some simple rules + scoring system. Players do the rest.   Only one choice per turn: -Draw a tile, or -Invoke &#34;Ra.&#34; Requires constant evaluation of host of factors.  Consider opponents and present them with difficult choices.

Distills to chit mechanic. 1 or 0.  Push your luck keeps everyone involved.  Not persistent tough choices - breaks. Lulls.   Best at 3-4. 5 - pieces and decisions spread too thin - less dynamic, more attritional; chance plays a bigger role - auction order, tokens.   One of my favourite games to play with family. LITE. Unlike Modern Art, all have some idea of what\&#39;s going on. Players are granted positive reinforcement more often and swings, the dynamic of the game more communicable because less strategic -  Decisions are easier to gauge.  Still enough to enjoy and analyse, though a shallower decline to the game\&#39;s depths than the drop off in other auctions.   Theme was initially repellent.  Do love shouting \&#39;ra!\&#39; My partner thought it was a lion\&#39;s roar and our interjections still reflect this - makes it quite lively. Modern art much more demure.  How about an animal kingdom theme?   Bag is fiddly - prefer just to turn everything over.  8.8 7.8 (29/12/19 - away adjusted)  Comparisons: • Modern Art • Medici • Neue Heimat/The Estates&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;We had a lot of fun playing Machina Arcana. What\&#39;s not to like about having access to a whole bunch of arcane weapons that you can upgrade and augment to make them even better? Who can honestly resist the temptation to wield a Chainsword?!  There are boots that let you move in a direction until you reach an obstacle, awesome. Items that let you teleport 1 space, no longer do you have to abide by the laws of walls like a puny little human.  Then there are those moments you think you have a great idea for the next turn... only to be stuck behind a door with 3 monsters on the other side *gulp*.  Or having all explorers gain 1 health, only to realize that the current horror card says explorers can\&#39;t gain health, sigh.  The manual could use some more work to clarify game mechanics though. Reading the \&#39;rules forum\&#39; over here at BGG and going through the &#34;Encyclopedia arcana&#34; on the official website is recommended. There are also some summary PDF\&#39;s in the \&#39;Files\&#39; section that were a big help to us for a quick reference while playing.  It is not a game you just casually start, it takes a looong time to progress through the chapters and collect gear. I\&#39;m talking hours. Inventory management for 4 players can also gobble up time. Start early in the day.   Of all the board game dungeon crawlers I have, this is the first.&#39;, 10.),

 (&#39;In 2011, I drove to an industrial area where there was a plastics factory where the owner also sold board games.  It was this single viewing room, where you could look around whilst the owner in plastic dust watched.  A very strange experience.    So, I bought this to remember the journey (and I had heard about it before being a unique racing game).  Alas, in 2019 there are simply much better racing games, and a single solo lap was enough to know I would never play this again or force it on the gaming group.  A case where the purchase was far more interesting that the game, and given only 12 games recorded on BGG this year, I am hardly not alone.  The game is simply too procedural and all about counting grids. It just doesnt seem fun.   Definitely time to say goodbye and free up the shelf space (Rating 3.643, Nov 19).&#39;, 4.),
 (&#34;Queen&#39;s Architect is a fun efficiency game with a few flaws. It&#39;s relatively easy to tell who is going to win by halfway through the game unless it&#39;s extremely close. The tavern action is generally not action efficient enough to bother with, and it&#39;s far too expensive to justify using it on a large number of worker types. In addition, it&#39;s an extremely strategy focused game, with very little tactical play. If everyone plays fast, particularly at 2 player, it should be fast enough that the flaws won&#39;t bother me, but I&#39;d really want to get through this game in no more than 45 minutes for how much I get out of it. If people take a long time with their turns, the game will become agonizing.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;I\&#39;ve actually rated this higher than my personal tastes would have dictated. It\&#39;s a very well produced game, with lots of nifty mechanics melded together relatively well. It is not language independent, but with a little additional effort &#34;possibly&#34; could have been. All you Caylus fans out there should enjoy this game. Thanks to Mike (last name?) at the Eugene Gala for introducing and explaining the rules. I think this is a solid purchase, even if you don\&#39;t speak German, so long as you download the instructions. I\&#39;m not sure if all of the cards are translated to english for download... It would have been nice to have included an english rule sheet. &#39;, 7.),

I would consider these a must upgrade. And I don&#39;t normally do upgrades.  Generally favorable first play. From a purely tactile perspective, it feels a little weird to draw small thin cardboard tokens out of a big bag all the time. This is about as Euro-y as a Euro can get. Very minimal player interaction (limited to taking/exhausting limited resources), leading to mostly multiplayer solitaire. I don&#39;t mind that, and it&#39;s a fun puzzle to tackle. Not for people averse to converting this to that, and converting that to get the other thing. There are a [i]lot[/i] of resource types, and based on my first play, it appears you can simply avoid some all together and still win, so that&#39;s interesting.&#34;, 8.),

 (&#39;Worker placement on a modular map for resources, then turn those resources either to development or to money(same as VP). To find the right balance between the two along with changing the turn order in your favor is important. Developments need workers also, that are placed on guild cards with three tiers. There is competition for limited room on the guild cards - two workers each can go to tier 1 and 2 and only one can go to tier 3. The workers can be also withdrawn from the game turning resources to VPs. I find the favors on the different guild cards a little unbalanced, sometimes turning the game to a race to the top tier of a particular guild card. Further play may change this point of view.&#39;, 5.),

Although it&#39;s not typically the type of game I gravitate toward, I had a lot of fun playing the game and would love the try the various characters included in the game as they all have a very distinct flavor to them. I also really liked how the game box was used as part of the game. I wonder if the game would a bit redundant after a while, especially since there are several monsters repeated throughout the deck but I would certainty give it another try!&#34;, 7.),

 (&#39;Funny, not good.&#39;, 4.),
 (&#34;Well I certainly don&#39;t appreciate the theme, but at it&#39;s heart this game is a mix between cut throat perfect information strategy, and drawing randomly from a bag containing points labeled &#39;you&#39; and points labeled &#39;opponent&#39;. It plays quickly so the large random element isn&#39;t a huge turn off, but it is pretty funny to have a game with such a huge dichotomy.   The randomness is in flipping over tiles, which can be anything. You may flip over a hunter who is pointing directly at you (which is bad, unless you&#39;re playing the hunters), or you might flip over a pheasant next to your fox (which is good if you&#39;re playing the non-human animals). All in all the heavy random element overshadows any strategic fun.&#34;, 4.),

 (&#34;Settlers of the Stone Age is different than the original Settlers of Catan. One of the big differences is the game board. In Settlers of the Stone Age, the game board and the numbers are always the same instead of always being different in every game. It&#39;s a bit more of a gamer&#39;s game than the original Settlers of Catan.  I find Settlers of the Stone Age a whole lot better and interesting than Starfarers of Catan which is another spin of the original game. I played Starfarers and hated it. Stone Age was different.  Another game might change the game&#39;s rating. Playing once or twice every now than is OK. Since the board is fix and all, I find that playing many games in a short time, the strategies would be more or less same in every game since the starting point is the same. The only varible would be the dices. What resources comes out at a given time.  &#34;, 8.),

 (&#39;A nice variation on &#34;dice as worker placement\&#39; ala Kingsburg.  There was a nice balance of things where high rolls and low rolls could both be good so luck wasn\&#39;t as big a factor.  Quality of bits is good for a small publisher.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;This is a very unique game in that it combines a word game with a dexterity game and throws in a speed component.  Random letter tiles are placed in a plastic tray (face-down, unlike the photo) that has snake-like tracks. Dice are thrown to determine the length (3-7 letters) and type (noun or verb) of word to be created. Then, all players scramble to get tiles out of the tracks. You can grab from any track, but it has to be from the front. Additionally, if you want to return a letter, you must put it in at the back, which sometimes forces you to waste time sliding tiles in order to make room for it. As soon as someone has created a word that fits the criteria, and has no extra tiles in front of them, they ring the bell and end the round.  The first player scores a small bonus plus a point for every letter in the word. Remaining players can score a point per letter for *any* word (even if it doesn&#39;t fit the criteria) that they&#39;ve completed, minus a point for any extra tiles. This scoring system makes it very interesting, since you should try to have at least some word to reduce the damage if you&#39;re not the first one done.  It was very chaotic, but that made it fun and it played very quickly. Vocabulary helped, of course, but it wasn&#39;t as essential as it is in other games.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;A thematic game. It plays competitively and each faction plays differently. Factions not entirely balanced. VERY difficult and expensive to collect and buy this game. The figures are nice.

 (&#39;I typically dislike Stefan Feld games, but this one was alright! Theme is certainly pasted on, but the way the dice work with the dial works out pretty well.

 (&#34;[u]Comments:[/u] Hanabi is a neat little card game that requires a group that can communicate well together and a decent amount of luck in card draws to complete the game successfully. It really helps if you have a player who has played the game a few times to offer tips. But really there isn&#39;t enough to this game to even make it a gateway game that I would enjoy playing more than once a year.

 (&#34;I&#39;m enjoying this more and more with each play.   I&#39;m a fan of Tichu, but in addition to being able to play with  2 or 3 players, I think an advantage of Haggis is that it&#39;s more accessible.

 (&#39;[b]THE DARK SIDE:[/b]  1. Dice-rolling luckfest. 2. Suck-it big-time collectability. 3. Bendy TIE fighters and X-Wings. 4. Simple ruleset. 5. Rubbish spacemap. 6. Horrendously expensive. 7. No scenarios. 8. Scale issues.  [b]THE LIGHT SIDE:[/b]  1. It\&#39;s freakin\&#39; Star Wars! In starships! 2. Peaow! Peaow! Zing! Zing! Wooosh! Kafizz! KABLOOOOOM! 3. You get to move the Millenium Falcon, and Slave-1 around your dining table with other adults, while making sound effects like those mentioned in No.2. 4. The miniatures are very good, detailed, nicely painted. 5. You can craft your own killer system of rules. 6. The artwork/graphic design on the ship stat cards is cool. 7. Some of the rules are kinda neat; the stat-card damage flip, and the ship class structure springs to mind. Actually, I quite dig the starfighter blocking mechanic as well. 8. Did I mention the whole Star Wars thing? In starships?   Okay, Okay. I hear the negative vibes, baby. I hear \&#39;em. Loud and clear. BUT - and it\&#39;s a big but - set this beauty up on a custom game-mat and invite people \&#39;round. Nothing draws in a gaggle of geeks faster than a wing of TIEs overshadowed by Star Destroyers. Nothing. Not even close. This is the one you want. Gameplay is a standard, simple, no fuss system of to-hit shield/maneuver ratings, move x-number of squares per turn ships, and rolling a skillets of dice to represent banks of turbolasers blasting. It works. Quickly and efficiently. Having said that the gameplay is simple, it does include a few buffs that shine it up, such as the one-shot strategic command actions. You may also build your own fleets using a Warhammer-style points mechanism; with a few minor exceptions - Rebel Cruiser pops into my thoughts - the ships are evenly rated point-for-point. The game will allow Droid Starfighters matched against TIEs and other nonsense; though my personal taste is to keep separate the Galactic Civil War and the earlier Clone Wars. But that\&#39;s just me. Nostalgic.   Like Zombies! just make up your own rules if you hate these. Or, better yet, slightly tweak the ones present - so as to still use the stat cards, etc. The pesky bent figures can be un-bent, so stop whining about that. A few also like their space battles played out on hex-maps, but I actually prefer the squares; it\&#39;s simple, quick, and less fussy. Also, the model scale troubles some folks. I don\&#39;t see why. If you want the Executor to the same scale, you\&#39;d need it to be 20\&#39; long and resting on a wheeled bed. Then you and your scale-freak buddies would need to push the bed around a small farmyard, dodging chickens; the TIEs resting on a nearby bedstand. It might rain...  [b]I rate this an &#34;7&#34; ONLY if I play using my own house rules.[/b] The game then has the chance to evolve into big, brash Star-Warsy fun.  [i]WARNING:[/i] If you want to play themed games, such as just ships from the Galactic Civil War, then be prepared to give Starship Battles a serious cash injection. You may have to remortgage your trailer.  [b]JEDI MASTER TIPS:[/b]  A. Limit the weapon ranges for Class 1,2, and 3 starships to 4 squares (on a 11/17 or 18x24 grid). This forces the bigger starships to actually, you know, manoeuvre about the play area.  B. Roll 2D10 rather than 1D20 to hit. C. Have Class 1 &amp; 2 ships block LOS.  D. Create some scenarios. The simplest, and most effective, scenario is to have the matchup resemble War at Sea: * players agree on a Fleet points total. * place 3 objective tokens separately somewhere abouts the middle section of the map you are using. * gift each token with a victory point value (50-100 points). * agree a points-based winning condition (a total of ships atomised and objective tokens captured). [i]For the objective token to be claimed, the player must have a Class 1-3 starship in the square, and no enemy ships in any adjacent square.[/i]  E. Buy a custom space-mat. F. Choose your Fighter Launch ships wisely. G. Add &#34;space terrain&#34; like asteroid fields, planets, etc, to liven up the map.  H. Increase the effectiveness of the following ships: [b]Luke\&#39;s X-wing, Vader\&#39;s TIE advanced, Boba Fett\&#39;s Slave One,[/b] and the [b]Millennium Falcon[/b] by firstly removing the attack bonus Class 1&amp;2 starships receive with ALL of their weapons when they attack those unique vessels; secondly by having them only able to target them when they close within a 2-square range. Yes, that makes them point-for-point a better deal than, say, Virago but, quite frankly, I don\&#39;t care and neither should you. This ruling increases the utility of those iconic ships, and stops them exploding like balloons at the start of every match - which is what usually happens, because no one wants the Falcon screaming around hosing down their TIE squadrons; so they target them with every turbolaser in the Galaxy. Every true Star Wars nut wants those particular starships zooming about the game until a few turns have passed, at least, and these rules gives them a bloody chance! Now, players will have to get their fighters moving, if they want to kill Boba Fett, who\&#39;s been haranguing their transports. &#39;, 7.),

 (&#39;I backed this on Kickstarter hoping for so much more. It plays and feels like an unfinished prototype. The art is beautiful but it is apparent that WAY more time was spent on the art and bits than on the gameplay itself.   It comes across as disjointed and feels like certain mechanics where just thrown in at the last minute. Also, the theme feels very pasted on. There is no narrative, no story about the kingdoms. I have no ideas why a certain card allows me to convert 2 magic to 1 honor. There is no flavor to the game at all.  There is a really great game here, I can feel it. I just wish the designers had actually spent some more time in development to finish the game than rushing it to Kickstarter. &#39;, 3.),

 (&#39;This is pretty much a standard push-your-luck game with drawing from a bag replacing rolling the dice.  Like Pickomino and its ilk, the &#34;push too far&#34; element is matching what you\&#39;ve already drawn, and the game also allows players to steal from other players by matching tiles, or swapping when drawing the monkey tile.    There are some neat tactical decisions to make based on the distribution of the animal chips and the balance factor of swapping the monkey chips at the risk of giving the chosen player a majority in those chips.  It\&#39;s a straightforward game that can be played with kids, but it has enough going on to make it more than just a mindless exercise in drawing tiles.  1 play: 2 players 3 plays: 3 players 1 play: 4 players&#39;, 6.),

 (&#39;This is an excellent game with many scenarios and quality components. If you like the age of big battleships this is a great intro to the system. I highly recommend the use of the tactical combat rules from the Dreadnoughts expansion.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;We love this game, but it we found it was super easy. We have never lost, or even come close to losing. The expansions are almost a necessity to make the game a challenge.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;I thought it was a good game in that it was quick and had good strategy. I just didn&#39;t find it as exciting as say a CCG like Magic or board games with more visual presence.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;sell?&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;More fun than I originally thought it would be. Bought the game from a charity shop, an interest in philosophy is recommend but not essential!&#39;, 4.),
 (&#39;See my review for more details...         &#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Iatan&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;This is an amazing game. The replayability is amazing: no two games feel the same. Only counting the activity cards, with the expansion, that&#39;s over 10 million possible set ups. Add to that the 9 different characters, 4^4 rmpart actions, and 20-odd event cards, and you&#39;ve got a rich game.a  The gameplay is simple, yet deep, just cutthroat enough. Plus, with 2, it plays in under an hour. Not once have I played this game without thinking I&#39;d play another one.  When played with 4, this becomes a 6.5.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;Best &#34;light drafting&#34; game I know.  Lives in my backpack because it\&#39;s easy to teach and play and plays 2 to 5.  Sad thing it made it harder to put 7 Wonders at the table.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;The theme and combat resolution simplicity of Diplomacy mixed with share management via a rondel-based action selection mechanic results in this modern gem.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;A chaotic racing game that is a hoot to play.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;Interesting system, plays okay, but a bit slow and a couple of &#39;funny&#39; things in the rules but otherwise this was a good first up effort by CA&#34;, 7.),
 (&#34;Based on 1 solo game against the automa where I won 21-20, but it was very close and I got lucky with the cards I got ! In summary it&#39;s not a game which is very complicated but it&#39;s very tight, quite thematic and very clever. It&#39;s definitely a game I&#39;m going to keep !&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;Dexterity game for the kids. Nothing for the adults.&#39;, 3.),
 (&#34;The multiple iterations of poker marked the transition from my early card games to the more interesting and exciting ones. I admit there is a certain nostalgia that sets in whenever I see anyone playing a poker game with nickels and dimes. Texas Hold&#39;em. 5 card draw. 7 card stud. Omaha. All of the possible permutations that exist when sitting around to play make this one of the most easily replayed games out there. Psychologically satisfying and rewarding when played with friends. Many a good evening have started with a game of poker. Cheers!&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;Flawless design with a mix of mechanics that work very well. It is a race to build palaces, but the players must also build a collective network of houses to get to the cities, where they gain the needed money via area majorities scoring. Characters with special powers add some spice. There is a bit of chaos and uncertainty with the simultaneous action selection, but the game has no randomness after setup and is quite strategic.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;Cool traitor mechanic. Some scenarios can be fun. Random. Light. It&#39;s ok.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#34;Solid game.  Some of the artwork is a bit meh.  Enjoyed the area control mechanic.  Well paced and didn&#39;t outstay its welcome.  Would play again.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;In Storage.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Fast and furious it does lend itself to the occasional runaway leader. Unfortunately can also be dominated by the machine-bots and their deck thinning abilities.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;A little light for my tastes, and one of the weaker Kosmos games.  I&#39;d usually rather play Odin&#39;s Ravens, Jambo, Mystery Rummy or Wyatt Earp.  Still fun, though.  I played with my niece, and it was a little too much math.  One more year and this will be a perfect game for her.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;Played at GenCon - great game, though I am not a fan of hidden traitor it fits the theme, looking forward to it being available, will be interesting to see how much luck vs strategy plays a part in the game with more plays&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Never expected to like this as much as I do. Goes to show you.  I look forward to trying the expansion.  (Update: Got a little tired and sold it)&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;This game isn’t awful.  However, in my first play I see two big drawbacks.  The first is that the mechanisms have little tie to the setting for me.  The second is that there is no “inflection point” comparable to train rusting in 18xx.&#39;, 5.),
 (&#34;I love train games. This one, in the 18xx wheelhouse, has a definite length to it which I very much appreciate. The one thing I don&#39;t enjoy about 18xx is that in many games the bank has to break and so you spend an hour or more nickel and dime-ing (?) a dollar here, a dollar there and it can drag. Here, it just ends, you know it&#39;s going to end and once all the best trains can be bought, the game isn&#39;t much longer. It&#39;s really a great design and very simple for an 18xx game. It has a 2D stock tracker, if you aren&#39;t the president you can&#39;t trash somebody&#39;s company and while I do enjoy that in some games, I don&#39;t always want it. This really feels like a game you could teach to somebody who has never played an 18xx before. And, unlike 1846, which a lot of people say is a good intro game, here you don&#39;t pay for track lays and there is onl one single terrain cost you need to be aware of and that is crossing a river. That&#39;s it. Very clean and smooth game.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;The evolution aspect of your animals is very well done and interesting.  I would have like to see that in a game that is not centered around a racing mechanism.  (Used copy from Danny Boy on DN) (Sold on Facebook marketplace)&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;There&#39;s some choice in staking out a spot or vying for control, but the choices aren&#39;t often all that meaningful. Rounds tend to finish with a string of random forced plays.  Fast playing. I prefer the ghost variant (white dice) to the vanilla game.  Good production but pricey and large for a featherlight dice chucker.&#34;, 5.),
 (&#39;A little bit Glory to Rome a little bit Race for the Galaxy. I really like the art style of this game as well as the game play - I might like it better 2 player than the other modes, but it is a good game no matter how you slice it.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;One solo play, great condition&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Nice simple racing game.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;This game has a very small footprint that I enjoy. The art is done well. I think there is some hidden depth as far as strategy goes but only more plays will tell. Currently the game doesn&#39;t jump out at me as being a standout. I will re-asses my thoughts on this game once I play it more.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;Really pointless brain-dead game.  M, who likes this game, states &#34;It\&#39;s not really a game, it\&#39;s just like a five minute experience.&#34;  I\&#39;m not sold.&#39;, 4.),
 (&#34;Abstract Eurogame that combines area control, draft, tile placement... Very original, it&#39;s difficult to compare to other games, it&#39;s pretty unique&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;Very good game, good materials. High lucky components. I love the week-based play system.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Lo juegas por primera vez y dices: &#34;wow, esto esta muy bien, jueguemos otra vez&#34;, a la 4º partida ya habras ocupado todas las cartas y quemado el juego, buena idea, pero este debiera ser un juego en caja grande con 1.000 cartas para no quemarse taaaaaan rapido (4º partidas no son nada), en todo caso entiendo que el formato actual es el mas conveniente comercialmente hablando.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;All the good features of History of the World but shorter, less luck dependent and with easy to grasp rules. I&#39;ve not yet played this enough to decide if Vinci deserves classic status but it certainly has that potential...[Update: this has had a really good run in my group of late. Some of the group were ambivalent about it a couple of years ago but it&#39;s come out almost every week recently and people are still demanding it. It&#39;s usurped Antike for the moment as our civ game of choice. A classic in every sense.]&#34;, 8.),
 (&#34;I&#39;ve played this game a lot, but only recently started counting how many games I&#39;ve played.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;This game nicely combines dice rolling with deck building. The game revolves around a central board split into four parts, the four seasons. Each season has a special set of dice, which you roll and execute the rolled action: collect resources, collect bonus point and buy cards. The cards bought have victory point and also special  effects which you can activate by spending the apropiate resources. The game is fun and quick paced, the design is wonderful. Although the cards are not the diversified, there any many copies.&#39;, 9.),

 (&#34;I&#39;m not a fan of trick taking games, but this one is pretty good.  Twisty enough to be interesting.  Why am I so bad at this game?  50+ plays.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;Good game (and great components!), but best with 4 players. Auction version is best to play, but does make the game go longer. AP can be a big problem if not managed properly. :)&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Trop long, trop de chance, mais le theme et les souvenirs de jeunesse en font encore un nom magique a mes oreilles.&#39;, 6.),

 (&#39;Currently my favorite card game as of April 2014. Always pushing it, and willing to teach it at any time. The kind of game I wish I had the inspiration to have invented myself.  &#39;, 10.),
 (&#39;Alea small box; German language only; Simultaneous action selection can be irritating, but it is short enough that you can roll with the punches.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;After three years it finally hits the table using the shareholder variant, and it plays much better than it reads.  Essentially Metro without the laughs — I mean this in a good way, as there is a bit more thinking regarding the choices to make that makes the table quiet.  Quite a reasonable game (Jan 15, Rating 7.123)&#39;, 7.),

 (&#34;I don&#39;t play 7 Wonders enough to learn all of the icons, so they are always a pain to decifer, especially in the third age, and because I play it so rarely and don&#39;t really have too much fun play it, I don&#39;t really have too much fun with it and don&#39;t play it all that often.  The game rules are easy to learn, except for the icons. The game play is fine, but not good. I am not bored or overwhelmed play it, but it doesn&#39;t really pull me in. The theme is a bit pasted on (why are our civilizations passing a resource around? At least with Sushi Go, you could say it is a conveyor belt).&#34;, 6.),

 (&#39;Light in content but fun overall&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;This game was as much fun as I was hoping! Really glad I picked it up when I had the chance.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;1 play  This is an action-selection set-collection sort of game, with a very-much pasted on theme. The action spaces are characters from the Holmes universe, each with a different effect. There are 3 standard actions always available, the rest being random (2 at start, another added each of the 6 rounds after the first). Players choose 3 different actions each round; any action chosen by both will be unavailable the following round. Actions allow players to gain search tokens (the currency of the game) or use them to acquire cards (either from a display, the deck, or maybe the other player). Cards are kept face up in personal displays, sorted by type; each card comes in a set of size 3-9. At the end, the player with the most of each card type scores the set value (=size of set) less the number of cards of that type which the other player collected. There are a few little twists (some cards face down and protected, optional cards to increase difficulty) but that&#39;s the gist, highest sum wins!  Decent, but not nearly as good as my favoirte 2er classic Battle Line!&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;Have played it 3 times&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;Fun if you don&#39;t use the stock rules (too restrictive).&#34;, 9.),
 (&#34;Way, way better than many give it credit(s) for. Awesome components and some great ideas here. It&#39;s not a full on strategic experience, but tactics are needed and there are thrills when the rolls are tweaked or go your way. Very immersive.   Any Browncoats who want a fun 90 minute romp lapping up theme in the &#39;Verse would love this IMHO. Make a couple of minor tweaks to the rules about the time tracker and use common sense with the rule/card interpretations... and you&#39;ll have a blast. The 3 boards/scenarios are just like the episodes they&#39;re based on too - with lots of replayability on them all, thanks to 70+ combinations of hero/sidekick crew and changing original &#39;episode&#39; character recommendations to keep it fresh.   This gets the fireflystore.net nod, that&#39;s for sure.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;這款平衡遊戲我個人覺得非常有趣，一開始要放上主要盤子的時候就很有難度，但是會很想挑戰，這款遊戲可以訓練孩子的專注力、耐心及平衡感，越急躁的孩子越需要靜下心來完成任務，是很不錯的專注力訓練遊戲。&#39;, 9.),
 (&#34;I like that there are numerous primates from which to choose, and that each has its own traits and abilities.  The fact that your options in this direct combat are driven by the five cards in your hand, with just a simple play-and-draw approach, didn&#39;t really engage me much in the game.  I do feel that Ben believably mapped each primate with a representative special ability, though.  I could see this game being some mindless fun, but in my opinion it relies too much on the players delighting in picturing apes fighting and flinging things at each other.  Sometimes imagining jumping onto someone, and then kicking them, amused me a little, I must confess, but I think this one&#39;s just not for me.&#34;, 4.),
 (&#34;Hey matey this is a fun game. It&#39;s also very long!&#34;, 8.),
 (&#34;Good or possibly great game.  I&#39;m not very good at this one yet.  I think it should have wider appeal than Tigris and Euphrates.  For Samurai fans that like fantasy games, try Conquest of the Fallen Lands.   &#34;, 8.),
 (&#34;Worker placement and some push your luck with a ninja theme.  Nice chunky components (those shruriken are great), but it&#39;s basically the same as most other midrange worker placement games.  Collect sets of stuff, trade stuff for stuff.  You&#39;ve seen it before.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#34;Gets bumped to an 8. I do keep playing this game. It doesn&#39;t do anything special, and I&#39;m not even sure there is that much real depth to the card play, but it scratches the points machine euro and light auction itch so well. It is a really great light to middle weight euro.  Fun filler auction game with a theme that has not been drowned yet. Like most auction games the true value of items can take a few plays to determine and the room for error is low. The game is genuinely short, 30mins, and gives you plenty to think about despite a simple rule set.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;Initial rating (11/2019): 8.5  Well balanced and interesting map. Passengers add an extra element to consider, proving additional strategy without much more complexity. Passengers also ad a race for points that provides a bit of tension. The long and short length destination tickets are nice. The unique art on the cards is also nice, but I wish the wilds were better differentiated. The plastic passenger figures and stackable point counters are nice. The point token stacked on the city locations are a bit fiddly and add to the setup time.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;PnP normal deck of cards&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;This one is pretty neat for a solo game. It plays/feels almost like a multiplayer coop game. The two-player variant also works fine. Only downside is the relatively cheap material of the cardstock used for the german version. On the other hand, at the price you get this game for (5 euro), what can you expect?&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;Finally took this out of the box about 18 years after purchase (10 of which it spent in storage).  My interest had been rekindled bt the good reputation the game has, and the fact that it is being used in some newer games.  At this point, the evaluation is preliminary, but I&#39;m a bit underwhelmed. There is a lot of good stuff in there (love the fog of war concepts, the notion of concentrated fire), and the game has an intriguing scale that makes division-sized battles quite manageable.  However, I&#39;m less enamoured of the chitpull system here than I thought I&#39;d be, even though I&#39;m a dyed-in-the wool chitpull fan all the way back to Across 5 Aprils. There just doesn&#39;t seem to be much of a feeling of the OODA loop that the best tactical systems out there (such as Tank Leader or TCS) generate at platoon scale. Yet, one would assume that by going up in scale, those effects are regimental/division command level would be [i]more[/i] pronounced, not less.  So this may be a good game and better than the hopeless crop of 1970s games without any command control systems, but perhaps not quite as good as I thought. Will play more to figure this out.    Finally, as others have pointed out, that the Germans activate by regiments and so separate out infantry and tanks misses one of the key advantages of the German approach during the war.  A major gaffe.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;Colourful and easy - just don’t lose pieces&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;This game gets a bad rap but I love it.  Me and my brother used to play this alot and he would always win. But I still loved playing it. &#39;, 7.),

 (&#39;Interesting city-building worker placement.  I doubt the gameplay improves with more than 2 players.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;A marvelous trick taking euro game.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;Maybe Trade&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;Overall: yeah but meh. Pretty good job in order to bring 7 Wonders to two players. Though, it doesn&#39;t quite capture what is fun in the original game. In Duel there is really lots of going on, maybe too much! Quick. Serious AP -warning.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;Risk 2210 offers a few improvements over its simpler cousin.  The random luck factor is still there, but the addition commanders and action cards add more depth to the game. The clerk in my local games store sold me on the game with the following line: &#34;You can shoot nukes at the moon!&#34;&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Great set of rules, especially for the time.  System 7 was devised by GDW when they were designing Fire &amp; Steel 15mm and needed a quick method of playtesting 1:20 scale Nappies, so they cut the scale by 1/2 and used cardboard counters.  This is where the&#34;7&#34; in the name came from = 7mm scale.    The system turned out so well that they decided to release the playtesting counters as its own free-standing game.  Aside from using counters, System 7 is the same, but scaled-down rules as Fire &amp; Steel.  I like my Napoleonic games large-scale (1:20) and these rules not only allowed you to own entire Napoleonic national armies for a few dollars, but played relatively simply.  I really liked how all the Regiments and Battalions were already organized. The note-keeping never bothered me.  I know the rules trend has moved away towards brigade level and single base units, but I\&#39;ll always be fond of playing at the battalion level.&#39;, 9.),

Επίσης σε κάθε γύρο βάζουμε στην τράπουλα και ένα σπέσιαλ φύλλο με ειδική ικανότητα. Μου άρεσε και το artwork στις κάρτες.

 (&#39;One of the best strategic game. A bit complex, but with high replayability and needs a bit more time than usual for a new player to fully get into the game. The 2012 version is already nice and contains the Jeweller expansion (tile).&#39;, 10.),
 (&#39;just okay.&#39;, 5.),
 (&#34;LOST CITIES! This is a great game. It scratches the same itch as Battle Line but it is a game my wife will actually play.   I love the risk of laying a new color. You are often forced to give your opponent points just so you don&#39;t have to lay on a color you know you can&#39;t get. The timing mechanic is also great. You need to wait until you get the right cards but if you wait too long, you will not get all of your cards laid.  You can have a round screwed over by unlucky draws. But over three rounds usually the person who plays better will win.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;Lots of difficult decisions for its short length. I prefer this to Twilight Struggle. The cards are well done but I am not a fan of the board or cover art.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;A bit of a math exercise at times with which offering to take.  I enjoy the mechanic of offerings, add cards to your hand and an extra action to the most attractive offer.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;felt like a very shifty co-op Caylus in a way; had a lot of game options that kept changing and needed to be paid attention to every turn; need some more play throughs for a better idea and feel of the game; intriguing though; played 4 and 5 player thus far&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;need to play this with 5 or 6    for sure ... titan without the theme&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;Gameplay is pretty straightforward, but leaves a lot of room for interesting decisions. You&#39;re building out a pyramid of trolls that are your primary resource generation while digging tunnels with tetris pieces.&#34;, 9.),
 (&#34;Despite being neither a wargame nor a Civil War fan, I really enjoyed this. Narrows down the choices so that a non-wargamer like me isn&#39;t overwhelmed and can actually have a good time. Thematically, I&#39;d probably be more interested in Memoir &#39;44.&#34;, 4.),

 (&#34;Not a fan of D&amp;D or 4v1 games.  Great production value and great gameplay.  Just not my cup of tea as I don&#39;t have all day to play a campaign.  The solo rules are fiddly, but now there is an app that helps with that.  Wish I would have been able to give that a try.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;Rating up a point after second 5 player advanced game, which great improvement over 3 player.  Nice unique system for voyaging and a number of subtle strategies hidden in the system. Can be a bit long, and pace does not accelerate through the game.  Potential for a lot of fun with right group. &#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;It&#39;s kind of a race for the best tech and more workers/shops. The other players will always be where you want to go. Still, I like it.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;R&amp;J&#39;, 4.),
 (&#34;This game cribs from many designer games and for the most part succeeds for me. It has an auction system reminiscent of Amun-Re and tile placement kind of similar to Alhambra, but in some ways beats that game for me since placement isn&#39;t as powerful or as critical as it can be in Alhambra. It&#39;s only problem for me is in it&#39;s production values. For the most part the game is fine, but the player mats are a plasticy-paper and they refuse to lie flat until some tiles are on it. Plus the building pre-requisites card is printed on both sides, but only includes 2 cards. That is unfortunate. But these things don&#39;t really hurt the game.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;4 player stratego, pretty much exactly as you would expect.  The bombs work a little differently, probably for the worst.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Wood insert from Game Guard, Estonia, upgraded buildings from Clever Steps, Poland, metal coins from Small Box Games, and hand-painted miniatures. Added custom laser-cut inserts.&#39;, 10.),
 (&#34;I really got into this late in high school. The components were inexpensive yet very cool and I loved the concept. Unfortunately, the paperwork was a bit much and the play was tedious. It&#39;s best with multiple cars in an arena format. I remember they came out with a computer version for the Commodore 64. The computer version was really loads of fun.&#34;, 4.),
 (&#34;Solid Knizia&#39;s game.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;Similar mechanics to Memoir \&#39;44 and Battle Cry. Added fantasy elements including &#34;Lore&#34;, (settings version of magic), is well blended into the game. Numerous expansions and available scenarios make for great replay value.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;More cards and variety is great for regular play, but Dixit is only a once-in-a-while experience for us now so having the base edition alone is enough (and I slightly prefer the base cards over Journey&#39;s).&#34;, 8.),
 (&#34;I think this is my favourite area control game. The GoT-lore, the shifting alliances, the interaction at the table; I&#39;m always having a blast. I don&#39;t no why, but I like it even better than Twilight Imperium 4.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;This is a solid war game covering an situation not often covered by Eastern Front games.  They system does a good job of handling artillery supply as well as some of the other unique features of early mobile warfare, especially the lack of command control and coordination on the Soviets parts.  This game is aimed towards those that like detail and are wanting a good simulation of the situation along with the complexity that gives that.  I enjoyed several full games and found both sides a challenge.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Galaxy Trucker meets MagBlast? Definitely interested Update: Backed on Kickstarter with Custom Board option.&#39;, 10.),
 (&#34;Pick up and deliver game. Great production but recommend playing the 3 baby wombat version with 4 players as it&#39;s too long for what it is with the full 4 baby game.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#34;As far as cooperative games go, this is the best one I&#39;ve played. Has a lot of theme, exciting gameplay, and intense moments.  Note:  Sleeved with Mayday Mini Euro Sleeves and Mayday Chimera Premiums for the large cards&#34;, 9.),
 (&#34;Throughly enjoyed this game. Can&#39;t wait to play again.&#34;, 8.),

 (&#39;reglas generales en español&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;This is a marvellous melding of theme with contemporary co-op Euro game. If future plays are equally enjoyable I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if I increase my rating to 9.  I played 3 games of this back-to-back-to-back. They were all two player games against a different Ancient One each time. Needless to say I was very impressed with the game, we don&#39;t often play the same game twice in a row, let alone three times.   The rules are very straight forward and the underlying mechanics are well implemented. Our games were surprisingly fast the longest was 1 hour and 40 minutes which saw us draw out the entire Mythos deck. Our fastest game was a little over an hour.  The only thing I&#39;m hesitant about is the variety in the Ancient Ones. They have only 4 mystery cards, 3 of which you see each game. The other decks all have plenty of cards. I have yet to play the same Ancient One twice so perhaps this concern isn&#39;t warranted. &#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;My game of choice for easing non-gamers into euros.  Tons of fun.  I highly recommend removing the 7 15+ routes and dealing 1 to each player (like in TTR:E) and discarding the rest.  Getting 2 compatible high-point routes in the initial draw is tough to beat.  Or, play with the 1910 or Big Cities load cards.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;Was disgusted they used the same pieces as Torres.  It made Torres less special, and this one seem cheaper.  That aside, it is a good game and I enjoyed playing it--I liked playing it with a full compliment of opponents--can&#39;t image it would be as much fun with fewer players.  2nd copy auction by Ed Sherman&#34;, 7.),
 (&#34;[i]A nice push-your-luck filler[/i][/size]  This is a game about deep sea diving where you try to get as much treasure as you can.  Push your luck comes in because there is a limited oxygen supply that is shared between all of the players.  There&#39;s only so much you can say about push-you-luck fillers, but it hits all of my criteria: :star: [b]Portable[/b] - It comes in a nice pocket-sized box, which is where fillers belong. :star: [b]Pretty[/b] - The components are fairly simple, but it&#39;s nicely visually appealing when its all set up. :star: [b]Meaningful Choices[/b] - It&#39;s no [thing=96848][/thing], but the decisions were tough enough that I had to pause for a couple seconds to think about it.  That&#39;s basically all you can ask for in a game like this.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;There was an audible gasp because I voted to eat the horse. 10/10 would play again.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Boring.  Nothing but filler.&#39;, 4.),
 (&#34;Too easy, and heavily biased towards the detective. But my 6-year old likes it and its a good introduction to deduction games - so I end up playing more than I should.  Update: And now its the turn for my younger son to love this. I guess it&#39;s a success with children.&#34;, 5.),
 (&#39;Clever game.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;This is one of the best games I&#39;ve played.  At first I thought the tile drawing aspect was too lucky, but it really just forces you to adapt your strategy and tactics to balance out and maximize your cubes.  How one places their leaders is key.&#34;, 9.),
 (&#34;I like the mathematical elements of Lost Cities, trying to calculate the odds of a particular expedition paying off.  There&#39;s enough randomness thrown in that even the best laid plans can go awry.  It can feel a bit frustrating at times if the cards simply won&#39;t cooperate, but I&#39;ll usually play if someone is interested.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;An especially interesting Empire Builder series game, if a little fiddly once Communism falls.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;A good dungeon crawl, didn&#39;t consume your whole day but was still fun!&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;Imported from England. The kids love it &#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Leave this in the gaming vault.  Look for 3rd edition, if you can find it, as it improves everything already good about 1st edition.  &#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;It\&#39;s a good quick game. For some reason, I just haven\&#39;t been able to get it to the table. I like that the game comes in a small box, which is one of it\&#39;s strong points. It does have some meat and potatoes, but after 5-6 plays, it feels like kinda the same. I refer to these games as &#34;batteries&#34;, which inevitably run out of juice :( &#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;A very nice co-operative game! I like that we are fictional super-heroes that remind a lot of the well known Marvel and DC ones! The variety is awesome if you through in some of the expansions! Infinite replayability and variable level of difficulty makes that an awesome game for me and my friends! If only there was less fidliness with the various situations that appear in the game...&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;I&#39;ve had sunburns and stomach flus that were more fun. &#34;, 2.),
 (&#39;Ok game, kinda fiddly. Bidding, placing tiles, reducing the garbage...hmmmmmm...&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;It has an Arkham Horror paint job, but this is just a boring dice game trying to pretend it&#39;s Arkham Horror.  Doesn&#39;t scratch the itch at all, I don&#39;t know what I was expecting.&#34;, 2.),
 (&#34;Appears laden and complex at start, but once you&#39;re into it, it is a fantastic two-player game&#34;, 9.),
 (&#34;The best of Colovini. Plays wonderful 2-4! Elegent mechanics, abstract without being overly dry. Fast and simple play yet strategic and absorbing. Don&#39;t let all the bits scare you!&#34;, 7.),

 (&#39;Oh wow, this is seriously original. Like it very much - my rating might go up if I get to play it with more people. Strangely, my copy shows an age recommendation of 14 and up - the 8+ mentioned here seem more realistic.&#39;, 8.),

 (&#34;Solo play isn&#39;t worth the setup time for me. Playing with 2 can be fun.&#34;, 6.),

 (&#39;Nice that it can be packed away - but takes a lot of space. only 2 players, fun, some strategy - but a bit flat in the long run.&#39;, 4.),
 (&#39;  Not bad, something missing for me.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Like most of the best roll-and-write games, this one allows a player to participate on every roll, not just when it is her turn. The game does not even pretend to have a theme --- just complete the columns and colors before the other guys do. My only issue with the game is that all the answer grids have the same pattern.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Nice mounted map but other production aspects are substandard.  Basically a reprint of original AH game.  Missed opportunity IMO.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;I read the rules and had to look for a game there. Once we got playing, we realized that there were some interesting tactical choices there, and it was fun when people got into the roles.  Worth to note it&#39;s the only game I&#39;ve ever played which allows new people to join mid-game.&#34;, 5.),
 (&#39; &#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Boring as standalone game, but quite good as an expansion to Ricochet Robots&#39;, 5.),

 (&#39;This is an excellent game on the Russian Civil War.  Components are a joy to look at and the strategy is extremely interesting.  My only problem was I found the rules difficult to read and spent a lot of time paging through the rules to find answers whenever questions came up.  &#39;, 9.),

 (&#39;Soooo good.  I really want a second copy so I can do some full squad marine on marine scenarios.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;If you like Jungle Speed, you will probably like this game, because it is very, very similar. In turn, each player turns over the top ingredient card of his or her own drawing pile. If an ingredient is uncovered that matches one of the ingredients laying in front of any of the other players, you need to pound on the plastic hamburger in the middle of the table as fast as possible. If you are fast enough, you collect one of the matching ingredients and earn 1 point at the end of the game. If you collect an ingredient of the same color as the last ingredient you took, however, you earn a 2 point penalty. Good to play with kids or as a fluffy filler.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Another game I would consider a classic. Action point based player turns with a real time element. This game was ahead of its time in mechanics and has extremely nice material (even for todays standards). I still like it a lot, even though the unforgivingness might scare away some newbies.&#39;, 9.),

 (&#34;Talisman is a game that I wanted to play for a long time before actually getting the opportunity to own it. Thankfully, the game pleasantly surprised me. It&#39;s not overly complex, has a good mix of strategy and luck, and doesn&#39;t punish you turn after turn for no reason. The fantasy setting makes the theme all the more fun. If you&#39;re looking for a casual romper filled with dragons and evil demons, then Talisman is the perfect game for you!&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;Buy on ebay june 07&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Fun tile placement and route building game.  Good for up to 6 but less is more strategic.  The game is not too long and the length is the same no mater the number of players. &#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Both an area majority game and a paladin majority game.  You try to get majorities in paladins and then use them to get majorities in provinces whenever Carolus Magnus comes around.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;I have mixed feelings on this one.  The theme is fun and I really enjoy playing this.  But (and this is a biggie) it&#39;s a member of a series of games (like Age of Renaissance) where the highest profit comes from attacking the weakest and taking them down, but the games balancing mechanism is for player to attack the strongest player who is benefiting for a rich get richer power curve economy inadequately constrained by action and resource limitations. &#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;Pretty good for a TSR game based on an IP. Works pretty well thematically, but can be super swingy and long thanks to the randomness of cards and dice. Fun for the EFNY fans.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Comment: Kan ook met 2 gespeeld worden, maar dan is het spel toch niet zo interactief en niet voldoende gebalanceerd.  27-12-2007: met Ann Degunsch: Gewonnen dankzij Chapel, en enkele grotere monumenten op het einde (zonder extra punten weliswaar).  Ann had dan wel een zeer goede tactiek om veel geld te vergaren, maar heeft deze uiteindelijk niet kunnen omzetten in de juiste grote gebouwen.  Tja, je moet ze ook in handen krijgen natuurlijk.  30-01-2008: met David Grietens en Chris.  Opnieuw gewonnen dankzij de kapel, hoewel David beweerde dat dit geen goede tactiek is.  Tja.. :-)&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;Interesting pickup and deliver game.  Takes a bit longer than you might imagine from reading the rules.  Endgame seems tricky.  My plays were two completely different conclusions and one play that went to about 2/3 finished and had to abort due to time.  Would definitely play again.  More of a brain-burner than I expected it to be.  After 3rd complete play with a thoroughly different resolution, I&#39;m sold.  Don&#39;t be deceived by those who call this purely a pickup and deliver as I do above.  There are some tricky calls to make here.  &#34;, 7.),
 (&#34;I can understand why some like this less than I do. But there just aren&#39;t any co-op games that run this perfect length of time and that are this simple to teach.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#34;After my first and second game: Seems to be a great game with no mindbreaking rules. I enjoyed it a lot - even when I lost my second game with nearly 1/3 less points than my opponent - and I don&#39;t really know why... But I don&#39;t matter: It was fun to play and I wish to play it again!  The game with its buildings are overproduced - although some of the buildings don&#39;t really fit the city-board... To really think about adding this game to my colllection, it&#39;s just to expensive for what it brings...&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;Just takes up space in a card drawer. I keep hoping I will open the drawer and it will be gone but some of the family likes it still. &#39;, 4.),

 (&#39;Great two player game that is quick and addicting.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;Well, it&#39;s better than Nero, but this is the best thing I can say about this. :(  Oh, and also very nice components. Too bad the mechanics are not so exciting and there are 9382 other games dealing much better with this very same theme.&#34;, 4.),
 (&#34;Clearly a kids set collection game. 12+ seems a bit generous, but that&#39;s probably due to the theme. Rated as an adult. &#34;, 5.),
 (&#39;Simple Rules. Love the cross reference of the clues. Much more strategy than it looks. Also the selections of words and phrases is funny and replayable. Love it. Gotta try it more often and with different groups of players.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Will sell/trade locally&#39;, 2.),
 (&#39;I have a few decks of Magic: the Gathering and I have to say that it is an enjoyable game. The only problem about it is that people who play M:tG are usually &#34;geeks&#34;, who threat this collectable card game as a big part of their lives. They have great decks that can barely be defeated and usually keep telling me that I don\&#39;t know how to play and I\&#39;m not worthy to get any card in my hands. I know I shouldn\&#39;t rate any game like that, but it\&#39;s a part of it, too.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Tile Placement &#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;Like all in the Empire Builder series, it&amp;#039;s a fine game that could be awesome if there were only some player interaction.  There&amp;#039;s almost none...it&amp;#039;s basically solitaire.  Some house rules and variants help to some degree.  Eurorails is my favorite in the series.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;The art and world-building here is really strong, though there&#39;s basically no pay off for the story.  The game play itself is all about pushing cubes around in resource conversions, but because the encounters are all random it&#39;s hard to make a long term strategy and sometimes you just can&#39;t really do anything, and sometimes you can.  There&#39;s a little bit you can do to mitigate the randomness, but the gains you get at every step of the game are so small that using these mitigation strategies are going to largely offset what you gain.  There&#39;s some variability here as far as what monsters you encounter, what class you play, how well the monsters roll etc. - but none of it really comes together into something I want to explore long term.  On the upside, once you get the hang of the game it&#39;s very quick and easy to play.  Overall, I wanted to love this game and to have it fill a nice of a nice solo game that bigger than microgame, but a small box game with a quick play time.  And it&#39;s that... but it&#39;s not much else.  It also is clearly a production of Kickstarter so it has a bag for... reasons?  And a bunch of blank cards (With art!) that no one will ever use.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#34;This can be a terrible game if played against non-gamers.  The game is predicated on the idea that each player wants to win.  But I played an Uncle and his teenage nephew.  Neither had seen it or heard of it.  After 3 or 4 standard turns, the uncle just simply started banging on me and ignored any obvious attacks on his nephew.  And vice/versa. It&#39;s hard to win against 2 to 1.  The amazing thing was they denied it, though I showed them about 5 straight turns where neither had a single attack against the other. The uncle simply wanted to clear the way for the nephew to win, because he felt his nephew had a bad self-image, and so, I was his patsy.   It did teach me a lesson.  Rules of games depend on certain assumptions.  In this case it is assumed each player wants to win.  When one player doesn&#39;t follow the assumed role, the game is ruined.&#34;, 4.),
 (&#39;My child likes it very much. Very good game for 5 year old child&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Reading/deducing/swaying-by-action the intentions of the other players with relatively little information to go on is an absolutely integral part of this game, both in piece placement and in decisions about scoring. If you don\&#39;t like that, you\&#39;ll [b]hate[/b] Ys. It also means that some people might enjoy playing more (or less) with players they know well.  I haven\&#39;t played enough to be certain about the game\&#39;s longer-term prospects. While players have certainly won due to having a better feel for the gameflow, or by better reading of other players\&#39; intentions, I\&#39;m not yet sure how much actual strategy / tactics has influenced our game outcomes.  In some ways, I like that much of scoring is relative rather than absolute - it forces a tradeoff-decision of &#34;do I leave my margin of lead narrow to be efficient but risk being overtaken, or spend effort on making it safer&#34;. But in other ways, it feels like a bandaid.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Sealed. &#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;uses the system from Balkoski&#39;s Operation Typhoon and Victory in the West but with additional rules layered on; has a gorgeous map and near gorgeous counters&#34;, 7.),
 (&#34;An enjoyable card-based game. It&#39;s quick and easy to play and the artwork on the cards is simply gorgeous. There isn&#39;t a huge amount of strategy involved but you do have to give a fair bit of consideration regarding which cards to pick and then play (as well as your opponents&#39;) as you attempt to collect points from your cards, some of which are reliant on you having already played other related cards. You don&#39;t have a great deal of control over which cards you have in your hand at any one time, which means that there&#39;s quite a bit of luck involved in the final outcome. It&#39;s definitely a fun game to play though.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;Offensive fun for everyone! My friends, wife, family, and myself have all had a great time playing. I can foresee it becoming stale though if we continue to bring it out as often as we have recently. Definitely great fun to break out at the occasional party.&#39;, 6.),

 (&#39;Quick-playing, simple, and with lots of decisions.  Avoids the &#34;too-long&#34; and &#34;too-static&#34; traps that many tactical games and especially [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/135/richard-h-berg]Berg[/url] games fall into by eliminating things like zone of control and armor ratings.  Has a tendency to get bogged down in AP, but there\&#39;s a great risk management and timing system here.  The rules bring out a lot of good tactics organically -- things like forming and holding lines, and keeping a few units in reserve are important.  Cards add fog of war and a lot of flavor to the game, as well as keep the rules explanation slim.  Biggest drawback to the game is the components.  Although the counters are nice, the cards are subpar and the maps are horribly ugly and hard to read.  This is fine for for the old standard of wargames, but as more publishers have moved to mounted, beautiful maps and high quality cards and counters, this standard is seeming more and more dated.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;only own iOS version. Have played it quite a bit. I really like the way that your options expand as the game progresses. Also, it&#39;s a worker placement game that isn&#39;t just about getting more workers! The app is good, but nothing when compared with the amazingness of the Agricola app.&#34;, 9.),
 (&#34;This game is as bad as Lifeboats with its sheer arbitrary screwage and worse, has player elimination problems. But it has one very small saving grace: theme. It&#39;s the theme that [i]might[/i] get me to play this again whereas I wouldn&#39;t touch Lifeboats at all now.&#34;, 5.),
 (&#39;Excellent game. There are not many options and card drawing can hose you. However the puzzle it puts forward each game is satisfying.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;Luck heavily outweighs any strategy.  Essentially an exercise in frustration.  Big &amp;quot;beat up on the loser&amp;quot; problem too.  The worst Knizia game I have ever played.  Even HE can produce a dog!  (And I generally like Knizia games a lot.)&#39;, 2.),
 (&#39;Fairly good character game and ok wargame.  My version is different than the one pictured.  It is the designers edition with a hard game board.  well used box is shabby.  I played this a lot in high school.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Brilliant game - I love it!  I like it becuase it is  heavily themed, each character is unique, and every game is different dependending on who you play with and who the Cylons are. For a bunch of gamers - this game is superb! For some non-gamers it is too complex and too long. The theme also puts some people off, particularly some of my female friends.&#39;, 10.),
 (&#39;Use to play large miniature games like Warhammer Fantasy. Battlelore (Second Edition) is a nice fast way of playing this type of game without the large expense and all day play.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Fun for the kids! As a grown up, I felt the rules were a little lacking in their presentation, but I always just push through and try to DM the game for my kids anyway.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Way better than Blokus. Use this one in class often.  Very good.&#39;, 8.),

 (&#39;Inspired. It doesn\&#39;t over-stay its welcome and the two mechanisms actually work well together.  In comparison to Turn the Tide (also blind-bidding), For Sale is very light and quick, whereas Turn the Tide is much longer and more balanced in that everyone plays the same hands. I like Turn the Tide, but For Sale is done before the blind-bidding can get old.  The only issue is figuring out which set of rules are &#34;correct&#34;. &#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;played once with two players.  I was amazed at how fast the game went,  It moves at the pace of a snowball rolling down a mountain.  I rather liked the game and the aspect of trying to figure out the opponents&#39; color.  However, my wife found the game boring and annoying so it was traded away&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;I love the quality of the components. Too often game publishers fail to grasp how dark images and artwork look when printed out. This game has bright, clear map pieces that look great with painted pieces.   I also like the effort made to build re-playability into the individual scenarios.&#39;, 8.),

 (&#34;An unabashed copycat of Ascension; also not as good as Ascension. Of course it still plays quite fine (mostly because of what&#39;s been stolen) but i prefer Ascension over this one. Also, possible runaway leader problem?&#34;, 6.),
 (&#34;Dan Verssen updates AH&#39;s old Naval War to modern standards (modern being mid-&#39;80s).  A fun and light game that doesn&#39;t stress reality but rather playability.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;Nice version 2 players can play. Pre-set board makes it easy to start.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Nice game, too long though. :sleep:&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;Really nice components, beautifully made. The game mechanism is actually quite clever, with different strategies to achieve more victory points. Haven&#39;t played the expansions yet, really excited.&#34;, 10.),
 (&#39;A bit &#34;meh&#34;. Nothing too intriguing. Simply playing this game just isn\&#39;t a fun experience.  The game system is very abstract. It takes time to read through the cards and learn all the symbols in your first game. Playing with new players is a bit too slow compared what you get out of this game. The basic turn structure is nice but it leads to a bit too slow playing game, at least this seems to be the case with new players and the game doesn\&#39;t flow like it should. This game a bit too tactical. It is impossible to plan ahead safely too much which leads  to a feeling of tightness but also unnecessary AP-risk.   It is a decent card combo/set collection game but eventually a very dry and abstract experience even though the artwork and components are nice. I don\&#39;t think there is any deeper game under the surface. &#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;Tactile, but ultimately not terribly interesting...abstracts just aren&#39;t my thing.&#34;, 4.),
 (&#39;O.K., but less substance than I was hoping for.&#39;, 6.),

 (&#39;I really enjoy this bluffing game.  This game has replaced Coup for me.  I enjoy making people lose their cards or not. &#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Excellent deduction game.  Good production.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Feels kind of like playing 3 games of clue all at once. Last player in 4 player game is at a huge disadvantage. Also, the end of the game is fairly anticlimactic, as it feels like someone explains the facts to you and everyone just ends up with varying degrees of &#34;I was right about these things&#34;.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;This is a cooperative game which largely involves each player looking for combos in the cards in their hands. I didn&#39;t feel like the game facilitated group play as much as individual co-play.  Also, my play-style was largely dictated by the character I played and by the choices of other players.  This is a cooperative game that doesn&#39;t allow players to get too close to it.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;More interesting to me than the card game.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Good party game, good laughs with this one&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;I never not have fun playing this game.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#34;Good game. Great for families and people new to gaming. Like the many different mechanisms. Growing, eating, laying new tiles. Hoping for more a &#39;more cards&#39; expansion to spice things up more.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;A good starter game to get the girls involved. Pretty looking, simple to play and has some strategy but not a lot of depth&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;I&#39;ve always enjoyed chess, but as a game I feel like it devolves once one side has been largely taken out and suddenly you have to figure out how to pin the King down. Maybe if you have memorized end game moves, you will know how to make this a smooth and quick process. But I&#39;ve always found it very difficult to achieve, and very easy to continue evading a capture, dragging the game out artificially (with, sometimes, a surprise turnaround). Ultimately, it&#39;s a bit tedious.  (This sort of tedious, extended game of trying to pin down ferrets is also the impression I get from my few tries at Go, and possibly why I wasn&#39;t particularly attracted to it. At least Chess has a part which isn&#39;t that!)  From a greater standpoint, I feel like the game was always intended to be a great simulation of war, and allow people to develop their brains to think in terms of how things work on the battlefield. Which, then, you play the game and it&#39;s like...yeah...probably not.  I mean, granted, I&#39;m not a soldier, a general, nor military strategist, so perhaps I&#39;m wrong. But the game fails to capture such issues as terrain, spies, training, and supply networks. Most ancient battles, purportedly, were not set-piece confrontations in an open field, they were sieges to take over centers of power or commerce. Tafl games probably are based on this siege-centric reality to war and so may be a better game if war simulation is the goal.  But more importantly, chess always seems to come down to running through a wide variety of iterations of possible options, to develop an optimal path. A real battle, I sense, is probably more like playing paper-rock-scissors, where you have to guess whether the other guy is going to go left or right, so that you zig or zag appropriately.  Neuroshima Hex is probably (again - not being an expert - but in my opinion) a much better simulation of a battle than chess is. You would have commanders moving people around into different positions, eyeing the other teams troops, to try and spot a moment of advantage and then call in the attack. Once that begins, it will mostly unfold on its own and you&#39;re just stuck with the results, hoping that you read everything correctly. Except, of course, in a real battle you would be operating in a fog of war. And chess doesn&#39;t even have that.  So...chess is a decent game. But I like to rate things to at least some extent based on what I think the designer was actually trying to achieve. In this case, I feel like it was a bit of a failure, which just happened to be fun despite the fact. &#34;, 6.),

The whole crane game idea is hilarious and one of my favorite mechanisms of all time. The second best mini game is the roller coaster.

Rebecca also enjoyed this but probably not as much as Emily. I had a good time playing this with them.  They are now 13 and 11 so this doesn&#39;t get played.  When my neice and nephew are the right age I&#39;m going to bring this out again and infect the next generation on gaming.  Packed away in the kids closet.&#34;, 6.),

 (&#39;Light waregame with a lot of tension and once in a while an open militairy conflict. Guerilla warfare is fast, really irritating and a constant threat. &#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;It&#39;s far from a flawless game, but just finding somthing so much better then the original RISK makes me happy. All players need to know how to play this game, otherwise this could be a very quick experience. Just expand fast enough over a couple of rounds and you&#39;ve won. Everyone needs to be able to identify these potential situations and take counter actions. If so, this becomes a really nice game. In other words this is not the kids game that the original RISK is. And the battles are much better. Still just dice rolling, but it does matter how you build up your armies with different troops and strengths.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#34;Hey - this game is better than I expected. I thought I&#39;d be lowering the score after the first play but the opposite is true. Many people criticize SoC for being a card game in disguise (I believed I would be one of them after having read the rules) but the truth of the matter is that you simply don&#39;t see and feel this mechanic while playing. You and your fellow players seem to automatically start role-playing their knights etc. and the atmosphere is brilliant. And boy, is the game hard - especially with a traitor. Even though you have to play cooperatively you really get a sense of accomplishment if you manage to win it (of course we failed the first time around, but we were more or less on the right track and that alone felt good :-D).&#34;, 8.),

 (&#34;This is a 2 player euro game with area control mechanics.  If you don&#39;t take it seriously it&#39;s fine to play.  If you want to be good at it and win, well you can be frustrated by the luck involved with the randomness of scoring cards and the die roll in coup attempts which is a high variance in outcomes and ususally things hinge a lot on them.  Doesn&#39;t put you fully into the frame of mind of the conflict.  Gameplay detracts from the theme.  I will avoid play of this over something like 1960&#34;, 4.),

 (&#34;I seem to be the only person I&#39;ve ever known who likes this game.  A quirky card game that, instead of suits, uses letters, pictures, numbers, etc.  Rather than matchin one card, you can play all your cards that add up to a certain number, or spell a word, etc.  Seems like it would be fun as an educational tool.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;Not my favorite game.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;It&#39;s a low/no-difficulty self-guided story that doesn&#39;t focus so much on your character vs. those around you. Minor value in going through a second time, probably none to do a third. Read about it, know what you&#39;re getting into, and enjoy the story it creates.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;This works fine as a pastime, but with games taking about 3 minutes each for us, it also has some of the feeling of Rock Paper Scissors (does anyone record plays of that?)  All 25 of my plays were consecutive in a single evening.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;This is an 9 for me when playing a solo variant. But is only a 7 when playing with others due to the down time, don&#39;t play this with those who are AP prone.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#34;Very good game, but not perfect. The name is very well chosen as playing it feels like a struggle between the Empires. The rulebook is terrible and the map design could have been so much better. Why waste so much space on UK, France, Spain while you don&#39;t need that map piece? Why place water on the border of Germany while you cannot go there with a ship? The alliance piece is the brilliant element in the game, but the random 30 countries markers that appear during the game influence too much what direction the game will take. Also, it is impossible, even with an alliance, to come back and win the game when you had some losses or bad luck with the dice. And then it takes a long time to finish. There are some very good elements for sure and it is a great game to play. But it is inferior in terms of some of the alliance and negotiation game elements that you can find in a game like Diplomacy (which obviously takes even longer to play, but has zero luck and has a flawless design).&#34;, 8.),

First, I\&#39;m not a fan of &#34;all auctions, all the time&#34; games, and this qualifies as such.  And second, it felt to me like a game where you\&#39;re not trying to win as much as you are trying to lose least.  That\&#39;s just not my kind of fun.&#39;, 5.),

It&#39;s a little confusing and a lot time consuming, so I wouldn&#39;t recommend it for casual players. But you give me a game where luck isn&#39;t a factor and I&#39;m all in.&#34;, 9.),
 (&#34;This game feels just a bit bloated. The hunt slows down the game without adding the right kind of press your luck or suspense. I respect that it can power a usurp strategy, but it just makes one person&#39;s turn drag on with so much yawning from the rest of the players.  The core of the game seems right up my alley. I&#39;ll try it again in a few weeks, but I&#39;m not itching to rush right back to it.  Perhaps it was extreme randomness that won&#39;t happen most games, but on our first play the only viable way to win was to take 2 lands. We never had enough temples on the map for the win condition and there were only 3 monsters available during the entire game! Medusa was buffed twice and just sat there locking down my troops. So much for multiple win conditions...&#34;, 5.),

A 5 as a game, would be a 7 of the fun it brings to every non-gamer group, but had to retract one because it is way overpriced for the flimsy card quality (and the ridiculous low amount of cards). Feels a bit like a cash grab.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;Love the concept of take your best show as the total of VP of the game. And the feeling of the game, I&#39;m competing to put the best show instead of compete for many ways to obtain VPs. It&#39;s hard to get the table, sadly.&#34;, 8.),

 (&#34;The pre-eminent card game in my house growing up in Akron, Ohio, so I&#39;m probably biased. That said, I play on a multi-player app now, and unlike other card games, I find I&#39;m simply not tiring of it. EDIT 6/20: I eventually did tire of it, and a 10 rating now seems a bit...dramatic and I&#39;m knocking it down a peg to 9.  There is more strategy involved here, and non-obvious strategy, than is given credit for in other comments and forum posts; just like with many forms of poker, there is a large element of luck (enough that a partnership of total novices can beat pros), but the better, more experienced players will absolutely win out more over time.

 (&#34;This game is great for a 4 player cooperative game. I don&#39;t think I would play this with less than 4 players because it is not as enjoyable. I never really liked the mechanic of having a dummy player on the board to simulate a player when it&#39;s less than the optimal player count. It&#39;s clearly best with 4 and only 4 players. The fact it&#39;s only great with 4 players knocks off a few points. It&#39;s difficult to get to the table.&#34;, 6.),

 (&#39;The same game as &#34;Agricola&#34;, though here there is not a so much tight pressure regarding the means to come by, due to the use of more options available. However, these features don´t make the game better or more interesting, just make it longer without adding anything significant.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;I love this game. One of my favourites. The theme is impressive and I love the challenge of making the best use of the cards every time in your hand. However, I find two issues on TS which have made me revise down my score: 1) Cards draw can decide a game 2) Knowing all the cards is way too important. Their effects, although make sense thematically, cannot be predicted unless you put the effort into memorising them. So someone who has memorised the cards has a clear advantage even over someone who may be playing things on a more strategic way (as card effects can destroy logical strategies based on board game play). That is problematic as cards act as a sort of Deus Ex Machina for players who have not played the game enough times to know that some effects in cards make useless some strategies. Why should someone know that placing influence on some countries is bad as a card will  later replace it by the enemy&#39;s influence? So getting better at this game means gradually memorising more and more cards. After learing the basic strategies, the good player is the one who knows where to put influence so that enemy event cards does not remove it from the board in later rounds.   I am playing in parallel TS and Polis Fight for the Hegemony, I have played a similar number of games to both, however, the latter feels a fairer (and better game). One in which you depend on interpreting the situation on the board and the potential moves of your opponent, and not so much on knowing by heart dozens of cards that act as a minefield for the strategies of players.  Anyway, I still enjoy very much TS and hope to keep on playing and gradually learning the cards.&#34;, 10.),
 (&#34;Fantastic deck-building game, the best I&#39;ve played in some time, since Trains I think. Nice variety in cards, nothing seems terrible, lots of different paths to victory.

 (&#39;Heavy Game: Falling in my ratings due to long play, Requires multiple plays to really understand.  I think rather highly of this, however just cannot get my group to play it. They do however enjoy CMC.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Plays: 1&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;One of my favourites, often played after the other games have been packed away. Don&#39;t feel the need for the expansions, it suits us just as it is&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;Excellent abstract game. Very intelligent, fast and simple!&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;Not bad! Civ games tend to be long, and this one is no different, with the game clocking in at 4.5 hours with rules and still not finishing the last round. But, I enjoyed the game and would happily play it again.  Comparing this to Through the Ages, it\&#39;s nice to see &#34;dudes on a map.&#34; I appreciate that TTA abstracts that out to streamline the game, but it\&#39;s nice to actually push some units around. I also like how a culture takeover is brought into the game.   The other odd thing though about this game is that, on one hand, you have a dizzying array of tech choices, but it also seems too easy to grab any given tech. You don\&#39;t really &#34;work your way up a tech tree.&#34; Instead, you spread around and customize as you wish given your situation. It\&#39;s a little weird, and it does mean you sacrifice a bit of feeling like you\&#39;re evolving over time.  Generally though, fun game, and if given the time, I\&#39;d play again.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Normally I am not put off by &#34;dry&#34; in a game, but this one is like the Sahara at 3:42 PM on July 9th. Combine that with the &#34;please draw an elephant&#34; and other card randomness that didn\&#39;t add any flavor... this won\&#39;t be played again.&#39;, 4.),
 (&#34;I&#39;m the designer of this game. &#34;, 6.),
 (&#34;This game is very overrated in my opinion. There&#39;s literally 5 minutes of story &amp; the different paths are virtually meaningless&#34;, 4.),

 (&#34;Pretty good game if you don&#39;t mind book work.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#34;Demoed at Geekway 2018 -  I&#39;m much more excited about the release of this game after checking it out.  Awesome mechanics and overall design.  We all agreed we left the demo impressed.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;SDJ  Great game.  I really enjoy this game.  Easy to learn with deceptive depth and strategy.  It plays as well with 2 as it does with 4.  Always played with the expansions.  Got in 2007  2007 Plays = 6 2008 Plays = 6 2009 Plays = 1 2010 Plays = 2 2011 Plays = 1 2012 Plays = 4 2013 Plays = 7&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;I would need to try this out with a lot of players to really get a feel for it. Though the most annoying part of the game is how poorly the guardrails attach and stay in place. That is rather disappointing.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Not much of a 2-player game fan. I have tried this with 4 people but it is VERY slow.  The main problem I have with the game is the sheer number of book keeping and decisions to go through. The concept is awesome and I love the ability to select whatever spell you want, but it also bogs the game down heavily.  Not really my favorite interest, but I can definitely appreciate it.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;I like the idea of switching sides, but I&#39;m not sure it works here. Role selection mechanism that precedes Puerto Rico or Citadels.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#34;Too long, no player interaction, lame dice rolling combat.  The only strategy to this is building a party to fill in your weaknesses.  Why would I do that when I could just play Descent and have friends be part of my team.  Would only replay with the accelerated experience variant and a bucket o&#39; beer.&#34;, 4.),
 (&#39;sort of a slapjack variant&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;C-version&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;Rating based on the german WDS edition. I have very fond memories of play with my old group of gaming buddies. Coolest occasion was one of the tribes resisting roman occupation ridiculously long - ruining the roman players well laid out plans - he didn&#39;t need the space at all, but got carried away, eventually costing him the game...&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;Family Game...nice....&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Bora Bora has the typical Feldian VP grab (everything earns VPs), but offers some unique dice use for actions. Solid game, but reminds me of Castles of Burgundy, which grew stale and mediocre to me after a few plays. I hope this one remains interesting.  Update. After a few more plays, I like it very much. Probably best with four players, however. My second favorite Feld design after Luna.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;regret buying this one&#39;, 3.),
 (&#34;A fun card game with an humoristic theme: decapitating nobles during the French revolution.  I think it acts as a good filler and I believe that despite the randomness of card shuffling, it works out with tactics.  However some very powerful cards can unbalance the game albeit I haven&#39;t run into it.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#34;One of the best card games I think I&#39;ve played in a while, especially since I hate deck building. A lot of fun.&#34;, 9.),
 (&#39;Great family game. Havent met anyone who doesn’t end up seeing the fun and then strategy this game brings. The tiles are top notch and appealing. I despise replacing all the tiles though after each turn and I’m usually the one to do it. Great game overall&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;Vast, strategic storytelling disguised as a card-driven wargame. Exquisitely asymmetrical, the narrative branches outward until you are left with something memorable and unique. Your Middle Earth. Your story. Long, tense and utterly immersive, this is as close to perfection as I&#39;ve found.&#34;, 10.),
 (&#39;A fine cooperative game, a bit easy, maybe a bit unbalanced for the traitor with many players.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Duplicate&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;Just a time waster, nothing more&#39;, 3.),
 (&#34;Excellent game. Simple rules and gameplay but with enough different strategies for longevity. This is definitely my favourite game of 2006. The theme is desert-dry but I&#39;m still coming back to this as a nice filler, 5 years later. &#34;, 9.),
 (&#39;Great family and party game. Harder than Jenga extreme.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Nice use of the dice to get the selection of characters.  It combines lucky-worker placement with a bit of screwage, together with resource management and building decision.  Only one play, made some mistakes which may change a bit the feeling.  First impression is that battles were too easy, but may be due to the mistakes.  And also a little bit repetitive.  Anyway, a nice game, original and funny.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;Oh boy, this is old school Euro - haven&#39;t played in years and so need to get back to table to re-assess.&#34;, 5.),
 (&#34;One of the nastiest games out there........play it with your kids and they&#39;ll seek revenge!&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;Tolkien would have loved that&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;50% Complete, 100% amazing.&#39;, 10.),
 (&#39;Pretty quick game that does exactly what you would think it does.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;I can see why this is the top ranked game. Four plays in, and I&#39;m only scratching the surface strategically.&#34;, 9.),
 (&#39;Tied with Panzer Leader as my second TAHGC game.  I had a lot of fun with this many years ago.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;    &#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;I think I lost this game somewhere. Too bad, it was pretty fun. &#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;They ruined the game by making half male, and half female cards. Now the first question is obvious and always removes half the board.&#39;, 1.),
 (&#34;I&#39;m not unhappy to have played a campaign of Charterstone but I never want to play it again. Charterstone takes a perfectly average worker placement game, renders elements of it utterly opaque, then lets you have at things. A storyline of sorts exists, but never really comes through, but my biggest issue is that by the end, we hadn&#39;t the faintest idea who was doing well except for the winner. The point differences between most places were around 150, except for second and third where the difference was 2. And neither of us thought we were doing well!&#34;, 5.),
 (&#39;Nice fast paced co-operative board game with DaD characters. It has good playtime, about 90 mins, its ideal if you dont have time for games like World of Warcraft Boardgame. Also its cool thing for Drizzt fans :).&#39;, 8.),

 (&#39;[microbadge=5]  Point salad game where you draft actions.  Too much work for each individual payoff.  Board also a visual mess.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;This can make for memorable gaming experiences, with the right crew in the right mood. Dislike the expansions, which in my opinion dilute the tension with their longer playtime and scope.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;A two-player gem.  Love the balance of movement and time that defines the gameplay.  Has definite Tetris aspects, which is always a plus.  Also has just a touch of a necessity to know what the other player has/needs to determine your own choice, which I like as well.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;:star: a theme you don&#39;t see every day, and it&#39;s handled pretty well :star: three different tiers of workers, and special abilities on each, are a great mechanism and offer a lot of decisions to make :star: it&#39;s deckbuilding, but you&#39;ll never get screwed by card draw randomness because you pick your cards every turn :star: I love the idea to make the cost of buying a thing depend on how many things there are to choose from - it doesn&#39;t really make much thematic sense to me, but it works well and is a fresh thing I haven&#39;t seen elsewhere :star: works with 5 players  :nostar: the sculpture scoring rules are a bit tricky to explain :nostar: I don&#39;t like the point tokens - they&#39;re small and with sharp corners, and different denominations are hard to tell apart; making them different colors and/or sizes would&#39;ve helped  ---------------------------  Sleeved - Arcane Tinmen Medium 57x89mm&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;I dont know what, but some is wrong with this game, i`ve played two times and sold it.&#39;, 4.),
 (&#34;*As indicated by my original review below, Tekhenu really let me down at two players. At the three player count, I was shocked by how much more the core gameplay hook improved.  If Tekhenu wasn&#39;t associated with Tascini&#39;s pedigree, I would never consider this game for future plays. My initial impression indicated that Tekhenu is nothing more than an overwrought resource management game. Tekhenu&#39;s obelisk lighting mechanism is it&#39;s primary game hook and unique spin on dice drafting. That obelisk mechanism looked to recapture some of the brilliance and elegance of Tascini&#39;s 2012 design Tzolk&#39;in: The Mayan Calendar. Instead Tekhenu&#39;s central mechanism requires a great deal of upkeep and contains an annoying puzzle that obfuscates future turn planning. Beyond that, Tekhenu features a fairly standard set of areas/sub mechanisms that all revolve around spending resources. If the foundational dice drafting element of Tekhenu was less cumbersome, I&#39;d likely be more forgiving of the game&#39;s secondary aspects. As those secondary aspects currently stand, they are awkwardly complex and exception heavy for what ultimately provide fairly simple results. At the end of our play we felt that selecting a lighter resource management game to play would be preferable to Tekhenu because, it could provide a similar puzzle, would have half the rules, half the upkeep, and play in half the time.

 (&#39;An enjoyable game.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;This was just too dry for me.  Played 2 times, it would likely go up with more plays, but I think I will probably avoid.&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;GenCon 2016 purchase&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;I love that oldschool board.  I also love the fact that you can pick up the German edition on ebay for less than a tenner.&#39;, 10.),
 (&#39;Avalon Hill recent release. The launch pad and timer in the new release make it a much better game.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#34;I&#39;d rather foolishly passed this over a couple of times. I think maybe the theme may do it a disservice, but I&#39;m scratching my head to think of how you&#39;d retheme it. A tidy, dice based 30 min Castles of Burgundy is how I&#39;d describe it. A very tidy design.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;70&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;First game was a disappointement because this has been highly recommended to me. Nice and straightforward family game but nothing more. Maybe I have to play a couple of more to find deeper strategies on this...  Just played my fifth game and I have to say this grows on you. There are many different things you can succeed with although the outcome usually depends on some right cards showing up at the right time. The best score varies a lot from game to game and I see that as a good thing since it brings variation to the game.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;A fun set collection/trading game from my favorite designer.  I really enjoy bringing this one out.  It&#39;s pretty easy to teach and has some unique things like the hand positioning that keeps it interesting.  Most people seem to really enjoy it as long as you don&#39;t tell them up front that the theme of the game is bean farming! hah!&#34;, 7.),
 (&#34;It&#39;s Munchkin.  I prefer the main set but this is good for variety every now and then. &#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;One of the first games I purchased and I am sooo glad that I did.  This game is beautiful and so much fun!  &#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;This is a pretty light game, as one could expect out of a game that&#39;s just dice and cards, but it&#39;s not one that has a lot of strategic decision-making driving the game.  You get a hand of cards at the start of the game that give you different combos to complete -- some are as familiar as three-of-a-kind or full houses, while others are a little more unique, and then some even have direct competition between players -- and when you complete the combo, you get a number of chips and discard the card.  The chips go toward helping you accomplish your goals (take an extra roll or an extra turn, give another player a card, or discard one of your cards in hand), so there&#39;s some tactics to how you play out your cards, but other than that, it&#39;s pretty luck-driven.  There are some cards that only give you one roll to meet the goal, so it&#39;s strictly a matter of rolling the right thing, and it&#39;s a little frustrating.  It&#39;s a short game, though, and I can see that with more players, more choices come into the game, but it&#39;s not particularly challenging.  It&#39;s fun enough, but nothing groundbreaking or distinctive.  3 plays: 2 players&#34;, 5.),
 (&#34;I hate small cards especially in a deck builder but I bought the game anyway.  The first time we played we played 2 games in a row (2 player) and had a fun time.  I am a bit concerned about replay value though.  Only time will tell.  For now it&#39;s a keeper.  UPDATE: replay value is fine.  I upped my rating.  I actually think this is more fun than Clank.  Small cards are not really a problem.  Would have preferred bigger cards but the game is fun so who cares!&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;Love the campaign, it is a lighter game but full of fun.&#39;, 10.),
 (&#39;Have fun with both the story of the game (rival private bus companies trying to get to generic bus stops to pick up and deliver patrons first?) and the cutthroat player interactions and it is very fun. The decisions can be tense and hard, but the gameplay is pretty easy, so it is pretty easy to get into. (May 2020).&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Loved the game, easy to follow rules and a fun play. Great replay value!&#39;, 8.),
 (&#34;Very nicely done. The game played well with the English rules and card manifest, and we found only a few minor ambiguities not already covered in the Q&amp;A. The system is mostly snips and pieces cobbled from elsewhere, but some bits, such as how salvo fire is handled, are really quite clever. There was plenty of atmosphere and narrative, and it looks simply splendid on the table--even the pictures don&#39;t do it justice. Recommended.   Playing time was about 3 hours excluding set-up (and be warned, the stickering is a project in its own right--don&#39;t expect to do it the first time you sit down with the game). &#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;All the excitement of operating a public utility. Very, very dry.&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;Simple but very realistic wargame.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;1 play.  &#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Chaotic but fun dice game especially at 6+ players. Not so good with 3 players.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;Good solid game. Let down by the cards being non-text to sell to all nations, can make learning (yikes! Remembering) the rules a little tricky. But nice easy game to play after you&#39;re head&#39;s been mashed by something more fiendishly complicated&#34;, 7.),
 (&#34;Deception has been extraordinarily successful with other couples and with my high school students. The components are high-quality, the mechanics are simple but original, and the game is simply addictive. I&#39;ll be anxious for expansions with new weapons and pieces of evidence.&#34;, 10.),
 (&#39;Awful horrible game. Designer should be castrated.&#39;, 1.),
 (&#34;Very interesting strategy game, with a lot of frustrations : there&#39;s a lot to do, and you can&#39;t do everything. What will you chose ? Thus, good replayability.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#34;Has some interesting cards, but I cannot stand the artwork on a majority of the cards.  What the hell happened?  The first Dominion set had maybe 1 or 2 cards with what I would consider sub-standard artwork.  Not only is Intrigue&#39;s art terrible, it&#39;s inconsistant.  Why do 2 of the cards look like Simpsons artwork?  That is just insulting to me. Did they have an art contest at a local high school to get the artwork for this expansion?&#34;, 6.),
 (&#34;I can&#39;t win at this game! I am 0-4, and not even close when I lose. I still really enjoy it as it&#39;s one of my two go-to worker placement games.&#34;, 9.),

 (&#39;Print and Play  Miniatures of chariots&#39;, 7.),
 (&#34;We liked this game, but we didn&#39;t like how the sandstorms worked (and that we got them all in the first half of the game).  We might try this next time with fewer in the deck or maybe a house rule to change how they work.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;[BGCOLOR=#FFFF00][COLOR=#000000]Family.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]  Party, Word. I enjoyed this, but it bogs down if people put too much thought into it instead of playing it kind of loose. Only one other person in my group liked it like I did, so I traded it.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Mainly played with Road to Legend expansion&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Really interesting network-building game with excellent components and a cute theme. Your goal is to get to the other end of the board and rescue your babies, but you can\&#39;t move freely; you can either move along unimpeded lines within your territory (marked by poop cubes) or wander in the wilderness (either by smelling nearby food, or by random chance.)   Relatively little luckiness is forced on the player, but choosing to go off the beaten path and take a risk can be very rewarding. The game requires a bit of planning ahead, as it takes a few turns after eating before you can &#34;expand your territory&#34;&#39;, 8.),

 (&#34;We played this a lot when I first got it. Then I won on turn three as Germany and I don&#39;t know that I&#39;ve played it since. That said, it adds a few good mechanics that were eventually added to the re-released base edition.&#34;, 6.),
 (&#39;Pass&#39;, 5.),
 (&#39;A very interesting trick-taking game. Similar to Gang of four but IMHO needs to be played by 2-on-2 teams.&#39;, 9.),
 (&#39;Pretty fun game.  Combat is generally very streamlined and quick.  And the theming is simply fantastic.  The only mildly frustrating element I find is that one or two players are generally on the recieving end of some bad choices during Navigation which makes it difficult to get started.  But personally I enjoy trying to guess what other players will do.&#39;, 7.),
 (&#39;Good game. Gorgeous components, especially the maps. The system is elegant but the rules for melee could be better organised. The historical scenario is very tough for the allies, as it should be. Quite a lot of downtime during the large scenarios when four people are playing.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Okay filler, but nothing great.  Has a press your luck mechanic that can be broken by people purposely dragon eating your needed card types.&#39;, 6.),

 (&#39;曾經得過門薩獎的遊戲，貓咪萬歲(Rat-a-Tat Cat)，玩家各有四張蓋起來的牌，一開始只能知道外面兩張是甚麼數字，遊戲最後是要比誰4張數字總和最&#34;小&#34;，為了要讓自己牌變小數字，每回合就要盡量去抽牌堆換牌，或是換別人的牌給自己，需要一些記憶，玩的好還需要騙騙人。我手上的是鐵盒紀念版，這鐵盒版的特殊之處在於有附一張西德最新超級顯影眼鏡(賭神梗，這還真●德國製)可以偷瞇(透視)全場所有的牌，威翻了~~每張牌都有經過特殊處理，讓顯影眼鏡不用翻牌就看光所有人底牌~~~~~~~~~~&#39;, 6.),
 (&#39;Fast playing card game on D-Day.  Fun the first few times, just not enough variety in play to keep interest high.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;Only a few plays so far. Like it a lot. A nice economic engine game that powers up quickly from one action each in the start to covering the board at the end. Turn limited and plays quick, so it doesn&#39;t overstay its welcome. Looking forward to figuring out more strategy for this game.&#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;Excellent economic game. Glad to have played this finally. Looking forward to play this more often.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Amazing.  Exceeded my expectations!   Easy to teach and learn, with amazing strategic depth and gameplay.   Excellent, competitive and combative tableau builder with unique board play.  Components are out of this world - simple, elegant and beautiful.  Must have for medium/heavy gamers.&#39;, 10.),
 (&#34;This game shares a lot of similarities to Greenland. From the very limited plays of both, I believe I enjoyed Greenland more. I found this one significantly more difficult based on the difficulty of getting a handsize, the bidding of daughters and the alpha male being useless until you unlock enough portals/elders.  I&#39;d like to do a complete Neanderthal/Greenland run, but I feel like I&#39;d had a hard time getting 2 other players to complete it with me.  A lot of chrome on this one and potentially more diversity in your culture based on daughters and starting sexuality.&#34;, 7.),

 (&#34;Despite the negative perception, our family quite enjoys this game. It plays remarkably quickly; there&#39;s not a tonne of meaningful, critical decisions - but that helps make the game light and accessible.  &#34;, 8.),
 (&#39;Felt like a very restricted version of carcassonne.&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;Good, when you haven&#39;t played dixit.&#34;, 5.),
 (&#34;Opaque scoring feels disconnected from the action-to-action gameplay. A game I just find boring for one reason or another, maybe because it&#39;s so calculating yet toothless?  Includes Concordia: Gallia / Corsica&#34;, 5.),
 (&#39;Much, much better than History of the World - great board and components, a very delicately-balanced game.  I&amp;#039;d recommend that the players all be on the same skill level, or someone&amp;#039;s going to run away with the game.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Simple, fun, intriguing, involving&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Classic filler - simple, plays well with widely different numbers of players.&#39;, 8.),
 (&#39;Thought this game looked cool. After 2 plays I am not as excited by this game as I thought I would be. Maybe my expectations were to high. There just seems to be something missing from this one.&#39;, 4.),
 (&#39;[b]Fun dexterity game. Fast to play.[/b]&#39;, 6.),
 (&#34;I&#39;m not entirely sure what to make of this one.  I had a lot of fun playing it but trying to outguess so many people left it feeling really random at times.  All the same the amount of groans when people got blocked yet again or excitement when a robber finally snuck through made this a very enjoyable filler.  Might be kind of group dependent but with the right gamers its a blast.&#34;, 7.),
 (&#39;I find no faults with this game. This is a brilliant card game with so much meat in the decision. Player interaction is high and I love it!&#39;, 10.),

<h2 id="Mixing-the-findings-from-Vader,-TextBlob,-and-vanilla-Sci-kit">Mixing the findings from Vader, TextBlob, and vanilla Sci-kit<a class="anchor-link" href="#Mixing-the-findings-from-Vader,-TextBlob,-and-vanilla-Sci-kit">&#182;</a></h2><p>After testing out each method used here. I found that Sci-kit's resources are incredibly fast and optimized, so In practice I'd like to use an approach with it. Additionally we found that smoothing these didn't have too much of an effect on the overall data.<br>
From Vader, I found that it actually might be best to just transition to losing the sentiment values from training and just use each word as a set of features for our training, as seen in TextBlob due to the increase of accruacy in results. However, TextBlob's problem with processing large amounts of data comes from its feature extraction method. So to speed this up we'll use essentially the same method it uses but port it to sci-kit.<br>
Here we break our data as usual into train and test. Then create a pipeline with a vectorized feature extractor for each review, then train it on the NaiveBayes classifier.</p>
