						<h3>Work to current date</h3>
						<h4>My time at Ayoka: January 2019 - current</h4>
						<p>
							Starting out at Ayoka I was initially hired on as an intern working on Web-application development.
							From the first day was trained on asp.netboilerplate framework, which incorporated ASP.NET backends and Razor page frontends. 
							I quickly became comfortable with creating simple and complex C.R.U.D. (create, read, update, delete) functionalities for applications, 
							and responsive layouts for user interfaces. Upon completing my training, I was tasked with various bug fixes, new features, and client meetings 
							for a medical insurance application described <a href="#projects">here</a>. Upon finishing my allotted time as an intern, I was recognized for my
							work here and was asked to continue working as an Associate Developer.
						</p>
						<p>
							As an Associate Developer, I was reassigned to a new project for a law-firm described <a href="#projects">here</a>. 
							I built this application from the ground up following the design and direction of another lead developer at Ayoka.
							Every feature I've implemented underwent rigorous development practices and code review standards that have molded the 
							developer that I am today. Upon completion of this project, I was tasked with assisting in training and teaching new developers and
							was a partial developer for a variety of projects implementing various bug fixes, and smaller features. 
							I was moved around up until I was tasked to find datapoints for a massive logistical tank tracking for an application rewrite. Essentially 
							I had to goto every input field of the site that could be a potential column in a database. I would've been fine with doing this by hand and manually 
							if there weren't over 3,000 visible input fields seen on the site. So I thought out of the box and ended up writting a python script mentioned <a href="#projects">here</a>.
							The task at hand was supposed to occupy my time for a month or two, but ended up being automated and accomplished within about three or four days! The script also
							ended up generating over 10,000 input fields both visible and not visible to the user and describing the data better than a person could have by hand.
							Upon completing this task, I was recognized for it and graduated to a Lead Developer.
						</p>
						<p>
							As a Lead Developer, I was initially introduced to a client that was in need of a application for claim and billing management of a warranty provider. 
						</p>
						<hr />
						
						<h3>Development methodologies</h3>
						<p>
							There are many different views and opinions over how one should go about development, here are a few of mine based on experince.
							I believe that projects that are the most successful are the ones that are the ones that were managed well. 
							To manage a project efficiently, the development personel should choose methodologies that best fit the projects needs and timeline.
							I'm not going to get into the pros and cons of each methodology, 
							however, I do think it is important to point out some successful techniques that I've incorportated into my projects.
						</p>
						<h4>before the project</h4>
						<p>
							At the start of any project, before anything is done at all,
							the project should be defined as much as humanly possible. 
							What should the project accomplish and what is the goal? 
							Who is the target audiance/user(s)? How will the user access the project?
							What is the timeline? What tools do we have at our disposal? 
							How will we deliver the project? Are there any issues that we see scaling up the application?
							At ABSOLUTE minimum, 
							these questions should be answered before progressing to requirement gathering.
						</p>
						<h4>starting the project</h4>
						<p>
							As mentioned above, after the project has been defined as much as possible, 
							the development team should move on to requirements gathering/defining. 
							In my opinion, this is the most critical part of the project, because it outlines 
							what the development team will be building for a unit of work. With well defined requirements 
							the development team can then move forward with designing and implementing the project.
						</p>
						<h4>During the project</h4>
						<p>
							At this point the development team will be working in an 
							Agile development software life cycle or a Waterfall development life cycle. 
							If the two items above are perfectly defined with and there will be no deviation from the requirements, 
							then the team will move forward with a Waterfall development life cycle and will develop the project in a linear fashion
							all the way to maintenence.
							However, if there are potential risks such as bugs, unexpected costs, changing requirements, etc. 
							then the development team should move forward in a Agile development life cycle. Because of most future uncertainties
							I like to minimize the risk to a project and will typically work with Agile development life cycles. 
							I also find this method attractive for it's use of task backlogs prioitized by 
							"what set of tasks are the highest prioity that we can get done in a sprint time frame".
						</p>
						<p>
							During development, I think it is important for the teams to participate in scrum, or something similar
							on a work day bases. During a scrum meeting team members should discuss what they've have worked on, what they will be working on, and if they've had any issues. 
							That way if problems arise, they can be dealt before they become bigger issues. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Once the project has hit a point where some features are useable and testable. 
							I believe a staging enviornment should be prepared and presented to the product owner for feedback. 
							That way feedback can be given, and corrections can be made on the fly. Typically at this stage, and if 
							the option and resources are available, I'd start to pursue Dev Ops techniques such as CI/CD, Continuous Integration
							and Continuous Delivery. Using techniques such as this, allows the developers to integrate and deliver almost seemlessly 
							to staging and production enviornments, speeding up deliverables to the project owner and users.

							<h2>Noteable Projects</h2>
						</header>
						<p>This section expands more on the projects section of my resume, and includes additional projects and tasks that I've worked on through the years that didn't make it to my resume.</p>
						<hr />
						<h3>Industry</h3>
						<h4>Ayoka</h4>
						<p id="medApp"><strong>Medical patient management and Insurance coding system (ASP.NET, Razor):</strong>  
							.</p>
						<p id="lawApp"><strong>Law-firm Case/Lead logistic system (ASP.NET, Razor):</strong> 
						As a team member, I have implemented and developed a web-application that evaluates the lead-providers 
						that law-firms pay and use to pursue cases for legal action or to drop cases that typically do not pan out. It includes 
						a ASP.NET backend with a mssql database, and a Razor page frontend. It also comprises of lead and case management, customizable 
						reporting, and secure file storage of legal documents.
						This project is currently being used in a production environment and is in the maintenance stage of its life cycle.</p>

						<p><strong>Web-scraper for Datapoint Analysis (Python, Selenium):</strong>  
						This application searches for all input
						fields that could be classified as datapoints to be analyzed for database design for
						application rewrites. Given a list of endpoints, this will output the name of each field,
						what type of data(text, numbers, files, etc), whether or not the datapoint is accessible
						on the front-end, and example values typically found for these data points.</p>

						<p><strong>Heavy machinery, warranty claim management and billing service (ASP.NET, Razor):</strong>  
						.</p>

						<h3>School</h3>
						<p><strong>Nursing Post-mortem care simulation (C#/Unity):</strong>  
						Collaborated with a team for our
						senior design project in conjunction with UTA’s Nursing Department, to produce a 3D

						hospice care for nursing students to receive first hand educational experience. </p>
						<p><strong>Recyclops - solution for plastic pollution (ASP.NET):</strong>  
						Database showcase project, that utilizes a web-based solution to solve the pollution problem. This was done by
